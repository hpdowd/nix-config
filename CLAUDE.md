`~/src/nix-config` — the NixOS flake that builds this ThinkPad, plus the dotfiles
it installs. Arch is gone: no dual boot, no fallback.

**The tiling mode's bar is waybar**, with swaync for notifications, swayosd for
the OSD and awww for the wallpaper. `noctalia` mode runs its own shell instead.
wayle held all four jobs between 2026-08-24 and 2026-08-27; it is still installed
and generated, but nothing starts it (`docs/adr/0051`).

```

```

`docs/ANATOMY.md` is the full map: every file, what it holds, and why the tree is
arranged this way.

## Most failures here are silent

Most of what has broken this machine broke without reporting anything: a waybar
module rendering empty instead of erroring, a script exiting 127, a `pkill`
matching nothing, a window rule whose appid never matches, an `mmsg` flag that
returns `{"error":…}` and exits 0, six absent language servers, a GTK `url()`
that fails without a log line. **A missing component and a broken one look
identical.** Exit status is not evidence.

Three habits follow, and they matter more than any single fact below.

- **Prefer generated config.** A typed home-manager option turns a typo into an
  evaluation error. See the tier rule.
- **Verify by output, not by exit status.** Run the command by hand and check
  that the output is non-empty: `rofi -no-config -h`,
  `nvim --headless '+checkhealth lsp' +qa`, the module's own `exec`.
- **Assert a floor.** A scan that stops matching passes by finding nothing, so
  `checks/static.sh` fails when a count drops below its floor.

**`docs/gotchas.md` is the catalogue.** Read the section for the area you are
about to change: Arch carryover, nixpkgs, desktop, waybar, power, editors,
theming, networking, secrets, scripts. It records what has already gone wrong,
including several theories that looked right and were not.

## Changing things

`rebuild` = `sudo nixos-rebuild switch --flake "$HOME/src/nix-config#thinkpad"`.

- **Gate first: `nix flake check`.** It builds the system *and* home closures, so
  a `buildEnv` collision surfaces there rather than halfway through a switch, and
  it runs statix, deadnix, shellcheck and `checks/static.sh`. An evaluate-only
  script catches neither failure; do not reintroduce one (`docs/adr/0010`).
- **`rebuild-test` for structural changes.** It applies without moving the boot
  default, so a mistake is one reboot from gone.
- **Except for `boot.kernelParams`, where `test` is wrong.** It writes no boot
  entry, so test-then-reboot lands back on the previous generation with the
  change reverted and nothing said. Use `switch` or `boot`. The tell is
  `/nix/var/nix/profiles/system` and `/run/current-system` pointing at different
  store paths.
- **Always quote a flake ref in zsh.** `EXTENDED_GLOB` makes `#` a pattern
  operator, so an unquoted `…#thinkpad` fails with `zsh: no matches found:`
  before `nixos-rebuild` runs, which looks like a broken path. Use `"$HOME/…"`;
  `~` does not expand inside double quotes.
- **Rebuild before reload.** Anything generated, and everything under
  `dotfiles/mango/` (a store path), needs a rebuild first. Reloading alone
  reloads what the last rebuild produced, which looks the same as the change
  having had no effect.

| Reload | How |
|---|---|
| zsh | new shell, or `source ~/.config/zsh/conf.d/<file>.zsh` |
| Mangowm | `~/.config/mango/scripts/reload.sh` — never under sudo |
| mode / bar | `mango-reload`, which restarts the bar too, via the `exec=` line that `reload_config` re-fires. `scripts/waybar/waybar-restart.sh` is the bar alone (docs/adr/0051) |
| GTK theme | `~/.config/mango/scripts/system/gtk-apply.sh` |
| kitty | `kill -SIGUSR1 $KITTY_PID` |
| foot, zed, htop, imv, yazi | restart the app |
| ncspot | mode switch re-points `config.toml`, then restart the app |
| nvim plugins | `:Lazy sync` |
| Equibop theme | mode switch — `apply_theme` writes `enabledThemes`, and a rebuild alone does not |

The bar's stylesheet is an exception: `reload_style_on_change` is on, so a
rebuild alone applies a CSS edit. The `.jsonc` still needs a restart.

**Two faces, by role.** 3270 Nerd Font is the bar's display face, at 13.5px and
bold — the size and the weight are one decision, because its regular goes thin
under 14px. Hack Nerd Font is body text: the rofi menus, wlogout, the terminal,
the editor and GTK. Symbols Nerd Font Mono leads the bar's stack, because 3270
patches icons in at its own narrow advance. `checks/static.sh` asserts all three.
"One font everywhere" is not the rule, and has been tried (`docs/adr/0059`).

Inputs are pinned by `flake.lock`. Re-lock deliberately with `nix flake update`,
never as a side effect of a build.

## Where configuration lives — three tiers

`~/.config/<app>` is produced by home-manager. **Edit under `dotfiles/`.**

| Tier | Mechanism | Use when | Declared in |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 — generated | `programs.<app>` | a native module exists — **the default** | `modules/home/{programs,waybar,theme}.nix` |
| 2 — store-based | `source = ../../dotfiles/X` | no module, or generating would lose hand-tuned data | `modules/home/dotfiles.nix` |
| 3 — out-of-store | `mkOutOfStoreSymlink` | the app rewrites its own config from its GUI | `corectrl` only |

Tier 1 is worth its churn for three reasons: typos become build failures, one
option owns both the package and its config, and values can be shared between
consumers.

### One palette

`modules/home/palette.nix` re-exports whichever of `modules/home/themes/*.nix`
that `modules/home/scheme.nix` names. Switching schemes is that one string plus a
rebuild. Five ship: `heartbox`, `mocha`, `mocha-high-contrast`, `gruvbox`, `nord`
(`docs/adr/0030`).

It feeds swaylock, imv, nvim, swaync, the lock-background ramp and the bar's six
generated layouts; and per mode, kitty, foot, rofi, ncspot, Equibop and mango.
The alternative is the same hex codes transcribed into four files with nothing
keeping them in step. A drifted palette looks like a deliberate choice, so it
gets a check rather than a convention: `checks/static.sh` asserts that every
generated colour is used and every reference resolves.

**Most of what the palette could not colour is generated from it**
(`docs/adr/0041`). `pkgs/default.nix` builds the GTK theme, the Kvantum theme and
the cursor set from the theme file's values; yazi's flavour and Zed's theme are
written from them. Only the **icon set** is still a name a program resolves
internally, along with noctalia's and nvim's. The bar draws individual names out
of that set — the window title's app icon, the minimized indicator, the battery
ladder — through `-gtk-icontheme()` in a generated `icons.css` (`docs/adr/0052`).

A theme file that names nothing buildable is still adoptable. `heartbox` is the
first: it exists as a colour scheme and nowhere else.

Those names are the half that fails silently — each falls back to its own default
and looks merely unstyled — so the check asserts that every one resolves and that
every generated artefact carries this palette's colours. `native = false` marks a
stand-in, reported on every run rather than left to be noticed; `heartbox`'s icon
set is the first.

Each theme declares its own `contrastFloor` and `ansiFloor`, measured rather than
chosen, and there is no global minimum under them. The assertion is only that a
theme is as legible as it claims, so it cannot fail a new scheme; it catches a
regression within one. Nord's comment colour is 1.69:1 and Heartbox's is 1.72:1.
Every scheme in service is audited, not only the selected one.

### What follows the mode

**`scheme.nix` is the artefact scheme; `modules/home/modes.nix` is the colour
one, per desktop mode** (`docs/adr/0034`). Artefacts are built, so they cannot
follow a runtime mode switch, and there is one set for the machine. Colour can
follow, where colour is the whole of a consumer's theme.

Following the mode: mango's `colors-<mode>.conf`, noctalia's `predefinedScheme`,
Equibop's theme filename, and kitty, foot, rofi and ncspot through a runtime
symlink that `apply_theme()` in `lib.sh` re-points. The per-mode halves are
generated by `modules/home/mode-theme.nix`, keyed by mode so that no scheme name
crosses the Nix→shell boundary. Equibop's is generated by `dotfiles.nix` with its
other config.

waybar and swaync do not run in noctalia mode and stay on `scheme.nix`, so the
divergence has a ceiling, and the ceiling is checked: every mode that runs them
must wear `scheme.nix`'s scheme, and only `noctalia` may differ. Build-time modes
were rejected — they buy only the half that is already one line.

Equibop needs no link: it enables a theme by filename from its own
`settings.json`, which `apply_theme` rewrites. The generated file is
`equibop/themes/<mode>.theme.css`.

### Five link paths a script owns

Four belong to `apply_theme`: `kitty/current-theme.conf`,
`foot/themes/noctalia`, `rofi/colors.rasi`, `ncspot/config.toml`. The fifth is
`wayle/config.toml`, re-pointed per layout and position by
`scripts/wayle/wayle-restart.sh`. wayle is installed but not started
(`docs/adr/0051`); the constraint applies regardless.

None may become an `xdg.configFile` — that is the two-owners activation failure —
and `checks/static.sh` asserts all five are absent from the generation. For
ncspot and wayle that means **`programs.ncspot.settings` and
`services.wayle.settings` must stay `{ }`**, because each module claims its path
the moment it holds one value. A missing link is silent in kitty, rofi and
ncspot, fatal in foot, and in wayle leaves a plausible bar that is not this one,
which is why `mode-theme.nix` and `wayle.nix` seed them at activation. See
`docs/gotchas.md` → Theming.

### Not generated, deliberately

`nvim`, `mango`, `swaync`, `glow` and `nwg-look` stay hand-written, though all of
them now take their colours from the palette. The reasons are in
`docs/SYSTEM.md` §6 — read that before finishing the job. See `docs/adr/0009`.

### Two traps that destroy work

- **`recursive = true` writes through an existing out-of-store symlink, into the
  repo.** Converting `mango` this way replaced 65 tracked files with
  self-referential symlinks and broke the live config. Delete `~/.config/X`
  first, so home-manager builds a fresh directory. `nixos-rebuild test` makes it
  worse: it creates no profile generation, so the new store path has no GC root.
- **Two owners for one path is an activation failure, not a merge.** If anything
  writes a file at runtime — `mango/config.conf` is the one left — git must not
  track it and no `xdg.configFile` may claim it.

Two techniques to try before accepting a mutable directory: manage a *file*
rather than a directory (`xdg.configFile."Kvantum/kvantum.kvconfig".source`
leaves the parent writable), and check whether the module merges instead of
linking. `programs.zed-editor` merges Nix settings into the real writable
`settings.json`, so declarative does not have to mean read-only.

## Writing shell here

Shell is the layer that breaks here; most failures catalogued in this repo are
shell failures. shellcheck and `checks/static.sh` run under `nix flake check`
over git-tracked files only, so a new script is ungated until `git add`.
`dotfiles/zsh/conf.d/*.zsh` is ungated entirely — no shebang, and shellcheck does
not handle zsh. See `docs/adr/0011`.

- `#!/usr/bin/env bash` — there is no `/bin/bash`. The symptom is exit 127 and
  silence.
- `pkill -f 'bin/foo$'`, never `pkill -x foo`. nixpkgs wraps binaries, so `comm`
  is `.foo-wrapped`, truncated to 15 characters. Drop the `$` if the process
  takes arguments: `-f` matches the whole command line, so the anchor misses.
- **To test for a process, match `comm`: `pgrep '^\.?foo'`.** `-x` misses the
  wrapper as above, and `-f` matches the guard's own shell — the cmdline of
  `pgrep -f 'foo$' || foo` ends in `foo`, so the guard is always true and the
  daemon never starts. Bare-invoked processes (`mango`, `kdeconnectd`) carry no
  path in their cmdline either, so `bin/` anchors do not help.
- `mmsg` takes verbs (`get`, `dispatch`, `watch`). The dwl-era `-s -d` flags
  return an error object and exit 0.
- Runtime state is `${XDG_STATE_HOME:-$HOME/.local/state}/mango`. Every reader
  and writer must agree, or a mode switch goes one-way with nothing logged.
- **Glyphs: literal UTF-8 in Nix, `$'\UXXXXXXXX'` escapes in shell.** Nix has no
  `\uXXXX` escape; shell has two forms, and `checks/static.sh` reads both, having
  once read only one and missed 39 glyphs from the wrong pack (`docs/adr/0057`).
  Verify with `jq -r` piped to a codepoint dump, never by eye.
- Run shellcheck as `nix shell nixpkgs#shellcheck -c …`. The
  `nix run … 2>/dev/null` form once swallowed all 24 findings and reported zero,
  which looks the same as a clean run.
- **Never run `dbus-update-activation-environment` or `systemctl --user
  import-environment` from a task shell.** Both overwrite the session's
  environment with the calling shell's. From inside this repo's devShell that
  injects `stdenv`, `IN_NIX_SHELL` and a scratchpad `XDG_CONFIG_HOME` into every
  user unit started afterwards, which left three applications reading and writing
  their config under `/tmp`. `docs/gotchas.md` → Session environment.

## This shell

zsh via `ZDOTDIR` (`dotfiles/zsh/conf.d/*.zsh`), with `EXTENDED_GLOB` on.
`cat`→`bat`, `ls`/`ll`/`la`→eza, `cd`→zoxide, `lf`→yazi, `zed`→`zeditor`.
**No package-manager alias** — packages go in `modules/home/packages.nix`,
followed by a rebuild. `$EDITOR` is `nvim`. Full inventory and keybinds:
`docs/SYSTEM.md` §7–8.

`ls` in `$HOME` with no arguments is a function that hides the clutter listed in
`_HOME_HIDE`; `ll` and `la` are the unfiltered escape hatches. That file opens
with `unalias ls l ll` because NixOS predefines those three, and an existing `ls`
alias makes `ls() { … }` a parse error that aborts the rest of the file, dropping
everything below it. Do not remove the `unalias`.

## Where to look

| When you're… | Read |
|---|---|
| asking what is in the repo, or why the tree is arranged this way | `docs/ANATOMY.md` — the flake, the lock, the file map |
| unsure how packages, profiles, wrappers or generated config work at all | `docs/NIX-PRIMER.md` — the mechanism under §6's tiers |
| about to change waybar, mango, the shell, editors, theming, secrets, or anything carried over from Arch | `docs/gotchas.md` — the failure catalogue, by area |
| chasing an app that lost its config, its login or its profile | `docs/gotchas.md` → Session environment, then Credentials and keyrings |
| asking how the machine is laid out, which keybind does what, or where a change belongs | `docs/SYSTEM.md` (§13 = known rough edges — check before reporting one as new) |
| about to undo something that looks redundant | `docs/adr/` — each record carries the failure that motivated it |
| changing the colour scheme, or any part of how the machine looks | `docs/THEME-MIGRATION.md` — the runbook; `docs/adr/0028` for why it splits in two, `docs/adr/0032` for what a theme file owns, `docs/adr/0034` for what follows the mode |
| hitting the GPU freeze, suspend drain or hibernation | `docs/gotchas.md` → Power, then `docs/SYSTEM.md` §9 |
| changing what a scheme reaches — cursor, Kvantum or GTK | `docs/adr/0041` |
| filing or triaging an issue | `docs/agents/issue-tracker.md`, `docs/agents/triage-labels.md` |

## Keeping this current

When a change alters what these files describe, update them in the same task,
unasked. Where this file and `docs/SYSTEM.md` disagree, this one wins — it is
kept current against failures.

Route new material by kind: a **decision** becomes an ADR, a **failure** goes in
`docs/gotchas.md`, the **file map** goes in `docs/ANATOMY.md`, and how to *use*
the machine goes in `docs/SYSTEM.md`. Keep none of it in a code comment. A
one-line reason plus a pointer is the target.

### Write it short

Documentation, comments and commit messages here are direct and concise. Say the
plain fact rather than the clever construction. The argument lives in one place —
the ADR or the gotchas entry — and everything else points at it. Writing it twice
creates two copies that drift.

- **Comments: a one-line reason plus a pointer.** `# <what and why>. docs/adr/00NN`
  A file past ~30% comment means text should move out. Never restate in a comment
  what the ADR beside it already argues. Every `docs/adr/NNNN` pointer is
  checked, so retire the citation with the record.
- **ADRs run ~100 lines.** Context, Decision, Consequences, and the failure that
  motivated it. Past 200 is worth trimming.
- **Prefer the assertion to the paragraph.** A check in `checks/static.sh` that
  fails when a fact stops being true is worth more than three sentences asking
  the reader to remember it, and it is shorter.
