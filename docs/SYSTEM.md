# System guide

An operator's manual for this machine: what the pieces are, where each one
lives, and how to change them.

This is the *orientation* document. Two others sit alongside it and answer
different questions:

| Document | Answers |
|---|---|
| **`docs/SYSTEM.md`** (this file) | How is the system laid out, and how do I use it? |
| `CLAUDE.md` | What has bitten us, and what must not be undone? |
| `docs/adr/` | Why is it built this way rather than the obvious way? |
| `docs/WORK-LOG.md` | What changed since 30 July 2026, and what did it cost? |

If something here contradicts `CLAUDE.md`, `CLAUDE.md` is the one kept current
against failures — trust it and fix this file.

## 1. The machine

| | |
|---|---|
| Hardware | ThinkPad L14 Gen 5, AMD CPU + integrated AMD GPU |
| OS | NixOS unstable (`26.11`), kernel `linuxPackages_latest` |
| Hostname | `thinkpad` |
| User | `henry` |
| Disk | `nvme0n1` — 476 GB, btrfs |
| RAM | 14 GiB. zram (zstd, 50%, priority 5) is the working swap; a 20 GiB btrfs swapfile on `@swap` exists only to hold a **hibernation** image |
| Display | eDP-1, 1920×1200 |
| WiFi | Qualcomm QCNFA765 (`wlp1s0`, `ath11k_pci`) |
| Compositor | Mangowm (Wayland) — the only desktop |
| Login | greetd + tuigreet on TTY, launching `mango` |

Installed 2026-07-29, migrating from Arch. **Arch is gone** — subvolumes, boot
entry and EFI residue were all deleted on 2026-07-30. There is no dual boot and
no fallback to it.

### Filesystem layout

One btrfs filesystem, five subvolumes, plus the EFI partition:

| Mount | Subvolume | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `/` | `@nixos` | The system. Rebuilt, never hand-edited |
| `/nix` | `@nix` | The store. Separate so GC churn doesn't touch `/` snapshots |
| `/home` | `@home` | **Carried across from Arch untouched.** Snapshotted by snapper |
| `/var/log` | `@log` | Kept out of root snapshots |
| `/swap` | `@swap` | The 20 GiB hibernation swapfile. **Mounted without compression** |
| `/boot` | — | vfat ESP, 1 GB, shared with the (now removed) Arch entry |

All btrfs mounts use `compress=zstd:3`, `noatime`, `discard=async` — **except
`@swap`**, which must not be compressed. btrfs refuses a compressed swapfile
and `swapon` reports `Invalid argument`, which reads like file corruption
rather than a wrong mount option. See §9.

**`@home` is the important one.** It survived the migration in place, which is
why your browser profile, credentials and pairings are all still there — and
also why a large amount of live data is in **no repository**. See §11.

## 2. The mental model

Three layers, and almost every question is "which layer does this belong to?"

```
  ┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
  │ 1. THE FLAKE           ~/src/nix-config                      │
  │    Declares the system: packages, services, kernel, users —  │
  │    and now most of the dotfiles too, as Nix expressions.     │
  │    Changing it does nothing until you rebuild.               │
  └───────────────┬─────────────────────────────────────────────┘
                  │  nixos-rebuild switch
                  ▼
  ┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
  │ 2. THE ACTIVATED SYSTEM   /run/current-system, /nix/store    │
  │    Read-only. /etc is generated. Home-manager GENERATES most │
  │    of ~/.config and links the rest in from the store.        │
  └───────────────┬─────────────────────────────────────────────┘
                  │  programs write at runtime
                  ▼
  ┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
  │ 3. RUNTIME STATE       ~/.local/state, ~/.local/share        │
  │    Mode, waybar layout, wallpaper, credentials. Mutable,     │
  │    deliberately outside the config tree, in no repo.         │
  └─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

Two rules follow from this and explain most of the surprises:

1. **`/etc` is generated and read-only.** Editing `/etc/tlp.conf` or
   `/etc/systemd/...` either fails or is silently reverted on the next rebuild.
   Change the flake instead.
2. **State must never live in the config tree.** A program writing into its own
   config directory is precisely what stops that directory from becoming a
   read-only store path. This is why `~/.local/state/mango/` exists — see
   `docs/adr/0003`.

**`dotfiles/` is shrinking by design.** Most configs are now generated by
`modules/home/programs.nix` and have no file here at all — `dotfiles/kitty/`,
`dotfiles/foot/`, `dotfiles/zed/`, `home/htop/`, `dotfiles/ncspot/`, `dotfiles/imv/` and
`dotfiles/ghostty/` were all deleted on 2026-08-01. If you go looking for a config
file and it is not in `dotfiles/`, it is generated: grep `modules/home/`. See §6.

**Do not move `flake.nix` down a level.** With it at the root, `dotfiles/` is
inside the flake and reachable by relative path — which is the only reason
dotfiles can be store-based at all. See `docs/adr/0001`.

---

## 4. The change loop

Every change follows the same shape: **edit the repo → rebuild → reload.**

### Commands

All defined as zsh aliases in `modules/home/shell.nix`:

| Alias | Does | When |
|---|---|---|
| `rebuild` | `nixos-rebuild switch` | Normal changes |
| `rebuild-test` | `nixos-rebuild test` | **Anything structural.** Applies now but does not touch the boot default — a mistake is one reboot from gone |
| `rebuild-boot` | `nixos-rebuild boot` | Apply at next boot only |
| `update` | `nix flake update` | Deliberately move the pinned inputs |
| `generations` | `nixos-rebuild list-generations` | See what you can roll back to |
| `gc` | `nix-collect-garbage --delete-older-than 30d` | Reclaim store space |
| `search` | `nix search nixpkgs` | Find a package name |
| `waybar-reload` | Restart waybar from the current state | After a `rebuild` that touched the bar |
| `mango-reload` | Re-apply the mode and dispatch `reload_config` | After a `rebuild` that touched keybinds, rules or autostart |

The mango scripts are not on `$PATH` — `~/.scripts` is, `~/.config/mango/scripts`
is not, and putting it there would drop 28 files with names like `mode.sh` into
command completion. The two that get typed by hand are aliased instead.

⚠️ Neither reload alias picks up repo edits on its own. `~/.config/mango` is a
store path, so **`rebuild` first, reload second** — running only the reload
restarts the bar against the config it already had, which looks exactly like the
change having no effect.

**Always quote the flake ref if you type it by hand.** zsh runs with
`EXTENDED_GLOB`, which makes `#` a pattern operator, so an unquoted
`~/src/nix-config#thinkpad` is parsed as a glob, matches nothing, and dies with
`zsh: no matches found:` before `nixos-rebuild` ever runs. It reads like a
broken path. The aliases already quote it.

### Rolling back

Generations are numbered and every `switch` makes one:

```
generations                      # list them
sudo nixos-rebuild switch --rollback   # previous generation
```

Or pick a specific one from the systemd-boot menu at boot. Currently ~20
generations exist, all from 2026-07-29 onward.

⚠️ **`rebuild-test` does not create a generation.** It activates without a GC
root, so a later `gc` can delete exactly the store path the running system is
using. Use `test` to try things; follow with `switch` once satisfied.

### Reloading, per component

Rebuilding is not always enough — most desktop pieces need a nudge:

| Changed | Apply with |
|---|---|
| Anything under `dotfiles/mango/` | `rebuild`, **then** `mango-reload` |
| Waybar layouts (`modules/home/waybar.nix`) or CSS | `rebuild`, then `waybar-reload` |
| kitty | `rebuild`, then `kill -SIGUSR1 $KITTY_PID` or Ctrl+Shift+F5 |
| foot | `rebuild`, then restart the terminal — no live reload |
| zed, htop, imv, yazi | `rebuild`, then restart the app |
| ncspot | `rebuild`; a mode switch re-points `config.toml`, then restart the app |
| wlogout | `rebuild` only — it is spawned fresh on each invocation |
| zsh config | `source ~/.config/zsh/conf.d/<file>.zsh`, or a new shell |
| Neovim plugins | `:Lazy sync` |
| GTK theme | `~/.config/mango/scripts/system/gtk-apply.sh` |
| Desktop mode | `~/.config/mango/scripts/modes/<mode>.sh` |
| `autostart.conf` | **Log out and back in** — `exec-once` only fires at compositor startup |

⚠️ **Almost nothing is live-editable any more, and this catches everyone once.**
`dotfiles/mango/` became a store path on 2026-07-30, and on 2026-08-01 the nine
programs above stopped having a file in this repo at all — they are generated
from Nix. So "edit the dotfile and reload" no longer works in either case:
there is nothing to edit for the generated ones, and the store copy of the
others does not change until you rebuild. **Reloading without rebuilding first
looks exactly like the change having had no effect.**

`corectrl` is the only entry where an edit is still live without a rebuild.

**Never `sudo` the mango scripts.** Under sudo `~` is `/root`, so they fail with
what looks like a broken install, and write root-owned files into a config tree
they should not touch. `reload.sh` refuses to run as root.

## 5. Where do I change X?

The routing table. Find the row, edit the file, apply as in §4.

### System

| Want to change | Edit |
|---|---|
| Install/remove a package | `modules/home/packages.nix` (user) or `modules/system/*.nix` (`environment.systemPackages`). **Not** for the nine in `programs.nix` — their module installs the package too |
| A systemd service | `modules/system/<concern>.nix` — **never** `/etc/systemd/` |
| Kernel or boot params | `modules/system/boot.nix` |
| Battery charge thresholds | `modules/system/power.nix` (`services.tlp`) — the waybar `full-at` follows automatically, see §9 |
| Hibernation, lid and power key | `modules/system/power.nix` (`services.logind`) — no `systemd.sleep`, there is no suspend phase to configure |
| When the machine dims, locks or idle-sleeps | `modules/home/default.nix` (`services.swayidle.timeouts`) |
| What a dying battery does | `modules/system/power.nix` (`services.upower`) — not logind |
| Timezone, keymap, keyd | `modules/system/locale.nix` |
| Firewall ports | `modules/system/networking.nix` |
| Fonts | `modules/system/fonts.nix` |
| Printer / scanner | `modules/system/printing.nix` |
| VMs, containers, Steam | `modules/system/virtualisation.nix` |

### User environment

| Want to change | Edit |
|---|---|
| Shell aliases | `dotfiles/zsh/conf.d/10-aliases.zsh` |
| Shell options | `dotfiles/zsh/conf.d/00-options.zsh` |
| `$PATH`, `$EDITOR` | `modules/home/shell.nix` |
| Default applications | `modules/home/default.nix` (`xdg.mimeApps`) — there is no `mimeapps.list` in this repo |
| Which scheme the machine wears | `modules/home/scheme.nix` — one string naming a file in `modules/home/themes/`. Change it and rebuild; `docs/adr/0030`. Currently `heartbox`. This is the **artefact** scheme: the built artefacts, the icon set, nvim, and every colour consumer not listed in the row below |
| Which scheme a desktop MODE wears | `modules/home/modes.nix` — one string per mode, same theme files (`docs/adr/0034`). Reaches mango's chrome, noctalia's own palette, and kitty, foot and rofi through a runtime symlink `apply_theme()` re-points. **Not** waybar or swaync, which do not run in noctalia mode and follow `scheme.nix` — so every mode that runs them must wear it. Only `noctalia` may differ; currently both are `heartbox` |
| The per-mode colours themselves | `modules/home/mode-theme.nix` — generates `kitty/colors-<mode>.conf`, `foot/colors-<mode>` and `rofi/colors-<mode>.rasi`, plus the activation seed for the three links. The colours are **not** in `programs.nix` any more |
| Any colour | `modules/home/palette.nix` — a dispatcher over `modules/home/themes/*.nix`, evaluating to one flat attrset. Feeds swaylock, imv, nvim, swaync, fsel, the lock-background ramp and the bar's `colors.css`. kitty, foot, rofi, ncspot, Equibop and mango take theirs **per mode** instead — `modules/home/mode-theme.nix` and `dotfiles.nix`, from `modes.nix` |
| Which schemes exist | `modules/home/themes/`. Five ship: `heartbox`, `mocha`, `mocha-high-contrast`, `gruvbox`, `nord`. All native but `heartbox`'s icon set, which is the repo's one stand-in (`native = false`) and is reported on every run. Every scheme **in service** (the artefact one plus every one `modes.nix` names) is contrast-audited by `checks/static.sh`, each against its own declared floors |
| The GTK / Qt / cursor theme | GENERATED from the selected theme file's colours by `pkgs/default.nix` — `paletteGtk`, `paletteKvantum`, `paletteCursors` (`docs/adr/0041`). yazi's flavour and Zed's theme are written the same way. Only the **icon set** is still a name in the `packages` block |
| nvim's colourscheme, Zed's theme, noctalia's scheme | the theme file's `apps` block. nvim and Zed take the **artefact** scheme's; noctalia takes the one `modes.nix` gives its mode, since it runs in that mode only (`docs/adr/0034`) |
| kitty, foot, zed, htop, yazi, ncspot, imv, wlogout | `modules/home/programs.nix` — generated, no file to edit |
| GTK/Qt theme, icons, cursor | `modules/home/theme.nix` |
| Which hand-written dotfiles get linked | `modules/home/dotfiles.nix` |
| Language servers | `modules/home/packages.nix` — nvim takes them from `$PATH` |

### Desktop

| Want to change | Edit |
|---|---|
| Keybinds | `dotfiles/mango/universal/bind.conf` (all modes) or `bind-shared.conf` |
| Window rules | `dotfiles/mango/universal/rule.conf` |
| Per-workspace layout | `dotfiles/mango/universal/tag.conf` |
| Startup programs | `dotfiles/mango/universal/autostart.conf`, or the per-mode one |
| Waybar modules | `modules/home/waybar.nix` — **generated.** There are no `config*.jsonc` files in this repo |
| Waybar appearance | `dotfiles/mango/waybar/style-*.css` — hand-written rules. Its `colors.css` is **generated** from `palette.nix`; do not add one to `dotfiles/` |
| rofi appearance | `dotfiles/rofi/config.rasi` — hand-written layout, shared by **every** menu in every mode. Its `lines: 12` is a **fixed height** and only the cap for `rofi -show drun\|run\|window\|calc\|emoji`; hand-built menus size themselves through `lib.sh`'s `rofi_menu <max>` (`-theme-str`, since `-l` loses to the theme — `docs/gotchas.md` → rofi). Its `colors.rasi` is a runtime symlink to `colors-<mode>.rasi` from `modules/home/mode-theme.nix`; do not declare it as an `xdg.configFile` |
| Session menu | `modules/home/programs.nix` (`programs.wlogout`); `dotfiles/wlogout/` holds only the six PNGs. **Adding an entry means bumping `-b` in the waybar `custom/power` on-click too** |
| When the screen locks | `modules/home/default.nix` (`services.swayidle`) |
| Launcher entries | fsel's `config.toml` is **generated** in `modules/home/dotfiles.nix`; menu contents are in the `scripts/menus/*.sh` that build them |
| rofi's look or modes | `dotfiles/rofi/config.rasi` — one file for both desktop modes |
| how tall a menu is | `lib.sh`'s `rofi_menu <max>`, at the call site — **not** `config.rasi`, and never `-l` |
| Wallpaper | `~/.local/share/mango/wallpaper.png` — **not** in the repo |

---

## 6. How configuration reaches `~/.config`

**There are three tiers, not two.** The 2026-08-01 pass moved most of the repo
into the first one, so a lot of what used to be a "dotfile" is now a Nix
expression with no file behind it. The tiers, best first:

### Tier 1 — GENERATED, by a native home-manager module

`modules/home/programs.nix` and `modules/home/waybar.nix`. Nix produces the
file from typed options; **there is no config file in this repo at all.**

| What | Module |
|---|---|
| kitty, foot | `programs.kitty`, `programs.foot` — colours come **per mode** from `modules/home/mode-theme.nix`, through a runtime symlink (`docs/adr/0034`), not from `palette.nix` directly |
| zed | `programs.zed-editor` |
| htop, imv, yazi | `programs.htop`, `programs.imv`, `programs.yazi` |
| ncspot | `programs.ncspot` — **`settings = { }` deliberately**: that leaves `config.toml` unclaimed for the per-mode symlink (`docs/adr/0034`). One value here re-claims it and breaks activation |
| wlogout | `programs.wlogout` |
| swaylock | `programs.swaylock` — **`package = null`**, see §9 |
| The three waybar layouts (x2 positions = 6 files) | `modules/home/waybar.nix` |

This is where a config should end up unless there is a reason it cannot. The
argument is not tidiness:

- **Typos become build failures.** This repo's signature bug is config that is
  wrong in a way *nothing reports* — the dead `mmsg -s -d` flags, empty
  `custom/*` modules, `appid:zen` matching nothing, six silently missing
  language servers. Typed options are the only mechanism here that turns that
  class of mistake into an error you cannot miss. `waybar.nix` goes further and
  asserts on a module name with no definition.
- **One owner for the package and its config.** `programs.kitty.enable`
  installs the package *and* writes the config, so removing it removes both.
  Previously `kitty` was in `packages.nix` while `kitty/` was in
  `dotfiles.nix`, with nothing tying them together.
- **Values can be shared.** The palette is one file
  (`modules/home/palette.nix`, selecting from `modules/home/themes/`) instead of sixteen hex codes transcribed into
  four with nothing keeping them in step — the terminals, the bar's
  `colors.css` and rofi's `colors-<mode>.rasi` all derive from it, and
  `checks/static.sh` asserts every generated name is used and every reference
  resolves. Likewise waybar's `full-at` is *read from* the TLP threshold rather
  than copied.

### Tier 2 — store-based, `source = ../../dotfiles/X`

The file stays hand-written but lands read-only in the store. Reproducible;
`~/.config/X` stops depending on this checkout existing. Changes need a
rebuild.

Currently: `mango` (with `recursive = true`), `nvim`, `swaync` (body only), `glow`,
`zsh/conf.d`, and `~/.scripts` — plus the file-level entries `Kvantum`,
`nwg-look`, `rofi/config.rasi` and the `gtk-3.0`/`gtk-4.0` assets.

> **`rofi/config.rasi` is declared as a FILE, not a directory.** rofi writes a
> cache and `rofi.png` next to it, so linking the parent would give one path two
> owners. It is also the only thing connecting rofi to this repo — nothing in
> the mango tree names it, and rofi with no config falls back to its built-in
> theme rather than erroring. Same shape as `elephant/menus.toml` before it: until
> 2026-08-09 it was hand-written and in no repo. See ADR 0014.

> **File-level is a variant of this tier, not a separate one.**
> `xdg.configFile."X/config".source` pins the *file* read-only while leaving
> the *directory* writable for sibling runtime files — home-manager links a
> directory-valued source as one symlink, but a file-valued one as a real
> directory containing a file symlink. `htop`, `ncspot` and `zed` used to need
> this; their native modules now do exactly the same thing internally, so it
> became upstream's problem. What is left is `Kvantum`, `nwg-look` and the GTK
> asset directories, plus `rofi/config.rasi`.

`mango` and `nvim` reached this tier by **moving the writer** rather than
accepting a mutable directory — nvim's `lazy-lock.json` moved to
`stdpath("state")`, and mango's runtime state to `~/.local/state/mango/`. That
is the general technique.

### Tier 3 — out-of-store, `mkOutOfStoreSymlink`

A live symlink into this checkout: edits take effect with no rebuild, but a
fresh clone gets a symlink pointing at nothing.

Currently **`corectrl` only** — it writes its own `.ini` and profiles from its
GUI, and that GUI is the entire point of the tool. This is what an honest
out-of-store entry looks like: not "not converted yet", but "converting it
would remove functionality".

### Assets — a fourth thing that is not a tier

`dotfiles/wlogout/` still exists but contains **no config**. It holds data a
*generated* config points at: wlogout's six PNGs. `programs.nix` references it
by relative path, so it ends up in the store as its own path. Don't mistake this
for an unconverted config.

`dotfiles/yazi/` was the same shape until the Catppuccin migration and is now
gone. It was fetched from a third-party repo for a while; since `docs/adr/0041`
it is **written from the palette** by `pkgs/yazi-flavor.nix`, because a flavour
is 220 lines of colour and nothing else. That is the preferred end state for
this category: generate it if it is only colour, fetch it if it is not, and
vendor it only if neither works.

Three more files left `dotfiles/` for the same reason in `docs/adr/0032`, each
because it held a scheme's **name**: `Kvantum/kvantum.kvconfig`,
`mango/noctalia/settings-pinned.json` and `nvim/lua/plugins/colorscheme.lua`.
A name is not a colour, so none of them showed up in a search for hex — which is
exactly how the Equibop theme stayed gruvbox through a whole migration.

`mango/universal/cursor.conf` joined them on 2026-08-18, for the fourth time the
same way: `universal/settings.conf` named the cursor theme by hand and kept
Catppuccin's through two scheme changes. It is now generated from
`config.home.pointerCursor` and `source=`d by `settings.conf`, alongside the
`colors-*.conf` siblings — so mango, GTK and `~/.icons/default` cannot disagree.
`docs/gotchas.md` → Theming has why it was invisible.

### What is deliberately NOT generated

Do not "finish the job" without reading these:

| Config | Why it stays a file |
|---|---|
| `nvim` | ~22 files of lazy.nvim config. `programs.neovim` with Nix-managed plugins is a *rewrite*, trading `:Lazy sync` for a rebuild per plugin bump. The store path already gives reproducibility. **Three files inside it ARE generated** and merged in the store — `lua/plugins/colorscheme.lua`, `lua/config/scheme.lua` and (conditionally) `lua/config/palette.lua`, because the colourscheme follows `scheme.nix` (`docs/adr/0032`) |
| `mango` | No module exists. `recursive = true` stays for a different reason than it used to: `config.conf` is a symlink `apply_mode` re-points (`docs/adr/0040`), and twelve *generated* files live inside the hand-written tree |
| `swaync` | `services.swaync` exists and works, but declares the unit that is deliberately **masked**. `autostart.conf` owns swaync's lifecycle so restyles apply on mode switch. Adopting the module flips that ownership and needs its own decision. **Never run both** |
| waybar CSS | Same reasoning — hand-tuned presentation is data |
| `glow`, `nwg-look` | No module at this pin |
| `corectrl` | Writes its own config from the GUI, and that GUI is the program |
| `noctalia/settings.json` | Same — noctalia rewrites it on every change. **Seeded and pinned, not linked**: see below |

### Four traps

⚠️ **Two owners on one path is an activation failure, not a merge.** This is
the one to internalise, because it is how every conversion goes wrong. A
config must be generated *or* linked, never both — moving an entry into
`programs.nix` means deleting it from `dotfiles.nix` **and** deleting the file
from `dotfiles/` in the same change. `waybar.nix` writes into `~/.config/mango/`,
which the recursive `mango` link also owns, and that only works because the
four `.jsonc` files were deleted from `dotfiles/mango/waybar/`. `walker/config.toml`
broke `rebuild` outright this way: tracked in git *and* written as a symlink by
every autostart file. It is gone with walker (ADR 0021); the shape is not.

⚠️ **"Declarative" and "writable" are not actually in tension.** That was an
artefact of only having symlinks. `programs.zed-editor` runs an activation
script that **merges** the Nix-declared settings into the real, writable
`settings.json` with `jq -n '$dynamic * $static'` — Zed keeps persisting its
own state, and the declared keys win on every rebuild. Before assuming a config
must be read-only to be declarative, check whether its module merges instead of
links.

⚠️ **`recursive = true` can destroy the repo.** It creates files *inside*
`~/.config/X` rather than one symlink. If `~/.config/X` is already an
out-of-store symlink into the checkout, those writes follow it in — converting
`mango` this way replaced 65 tracked files with self-referential symlinks.
Delete `~/.config/X` first so home-manager builds a fresh directory.

⚠️ **The link source must be outside `~/.config`**, because
`xdg.configFile.<name>` writes *to* `~/.config/<name>`. That is why this repo
lives at `~/src/nix-config` and not at `~/.config` as it did under Arch.

### A fourth option: seeded, and pinned

`~/.config/noctalia/` is claimed by **nothing** in this repo — not
`xdg.configFile`, not `home.file`. noctalia rewrites `settings.json` itself, so
owning the path would be an activation failure, and `mkOutOfStoreSymlink` (tier
3) would put a file it rewrites back inside the checkout.

Instead `scripts/modes/noctalia.sh` writes it in two halves that differ in
**when** they apply:

| File | Applied | Holds |
|---|---|---|
| `noctalia/settings.json` | once, when there is no file at all | preferences — terminal command, changelog popup, telemetry. Yours to change from noctalia's UI afterwards |
| `noctalia/settings-pinned.json` | on **every** entry into the mode | the keys that would fight this machine — wallpaper, night light, idle, lock-on-suspend, gsettings sync, app theming (off for good, `docs/adr/0036`), plugin updates, and the colour scheme. **Generated** from the selected theme's `apps.noctalia`, so it is not under `dotfiles/` |

Both are partial and deliberately carry no `settingsVersion`; everything else
comes from the package's own `Assets/settings-default.json`, and upstream's
migrations all guard on the old key being present, so they no-op against a
partial file rather than corrupting it. The pin is a `jq -s '.[0] * .[1]'`
recursive merge, so it replaces the leaves it names and leaves everything else
noctalia has written alone.

⚠️ **Editing the seed does nothing to this machine** — it has run the mode, so
the file exists and the seed is never consulted again. That is the half the pin
exists to answer. A setting that must hold goes in `settings-pinned.json`; the
cost is that noctalia's own Settings UI will visibly revert it on the next mode
switch, which is deliberate for the colour scheme (the palette is machine-wide,
§6 and `modules/home/palette.nix`) and is why everything else stays in the seed.

Reach for this shape when a program rewrites its config *and* its defaults are
mostly right: you get a known-good first run and a small set of invariants that
keep holding, without signing up to own the file forever.
`docs/adr/0020`, amended by `docs/adr/0022`.

### Removing noctalia

The whole mode comes out in one pass, and `nix flake check` fails until it is
complete — `checks/static.sh` asserts the mode list and the mode files agree in
both directions, so a half-removal cannot pass the gate. The four noctalia-only
assertions (settings keys, colour scheme, layer namespaces, package present) are
gated on `dotfiles/mango/noctalia/` existing, so they leave with the directory
rather than failing after it.

**This list is tested, not asserted** (2026-08-16): applied to a scratch copy of
the tree it leaves `checks/static.sh` at 30 passed / 0 failed, the four
noctalia-gated assertions correctly skipping. Deleting only the directory fails
on two counts. Seven files go, ten are edited.

```
git rm -r dotfiles/mango/noctalia \
          dotfiles/mango/scripts/modes/noctalia.sh \
          dotfiles/mango/scripts/modes/noctalia-start.sh
```

Then revert, in order of how easy each is to miss:

| File | Change |
|---|---|
| `scripts/desktop-mode.sh` | drop `"noctalia"` from `MODES=(…)` — keep it one line |
| `scripts/lib.sh` | delete `mode_has_waybar()` |
| `scripts/waybar/waybar-{restart,layout,position}.sh` | delete the three guards that call it |
| `tiling/autostart.conf` | delete the `systemctl --user stop noctalia` line |
| `modules/home/default.nix` | delete `systemd.user.services.noctalia` |
| `modules/system/desktop.nix` | delete `noctalia-shell` |
| `modules/home/default.nix` | drop `NOCTALIA_PAM_SERVICE` with the unit |
| `scripts/menus/shell.sh` | delete the two `fb=none` rows — calendar and dock. Every other row has a fallback and keeps working, `control-center` included; the noctalia branch is only reached when the mode is selected |
| `pkgs/default.nix` | delete `lockscreen`'s noctalia branch and its `noctalia-shell` runtime input (`docs/adr/0024`); what is left is the swaylock wrapper it was |
| `pkgs/default.nix` | delete the `noctalia-shell` overrideAttrs — the `mmsg` verb patch (`docs/adr/0025`) |

Every **shared** bind can stay exactly as it is: they all name
`scripts/menus/shell.sh`, whose noctalia branch is only reached when
`current_mode` says so, which after this is never. The nine fallbacks — fsel,
rofi, swaync, `lockscreen -f` — are what a machine without noctalia was using
anyway. `universal/bind-shared.conf` keeps its name; it was
`bind-tiling-hud.conf` and that name is the one that would be wrong.

Finally, `rm -rf ~/.config/noctalia ~/.cache/noctalia` — neither is managed, so
nothing else will clear them.

## 7. The desktop

### Mangowm

A Wayland compositor in the dwl/dwm lineage: tags (workspaces), a master/stack
layout, keyboard-driven. Config lives in `dotfiles/mango/`, split into:

- **`universal/`** — shared across modes: binds, window rules, tags, settings, autostart
- **`tiling/`, `noctalia/`** — per-mode compositor config and autostart.
  `noctalia/` carries three more: `bind.conf` (keys that exist in no other
  mode), and `settings.json` + `settings-pinned.json`, which are written into
  `~/.config/noctalia/` rather than linked (§6)

**`config.conf` is generated, not authored.** A mode script copies
`<mode>/<mode>.conf` over it verbatim; that copy is what mango
reads, and it `source=`s every keybind, rule and autostart file. It is
gitignored because tracking it would mean committing a duplicate that changes
on every mode switch.

> **Fresh clone:** there is no `config.conf`, so mango starts on built-in
> defaults — no waybar, no keybinds — until you run
> `~/.config/mango/scripts/modes/tiling.sh` once and log back in.

### Modes and layouts

Three independent switches, all on the `/` key:

| | Options | Bind | State file |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Desktop mode** | `tiling`, `noctalia` | `SUPER+CTRL+/` | `~/.local/state/mango/current-mode` |
| **Waybar layout** | `full`, `focus`, `minimal` | `SUPER+/` | `~/.local/state/mango/waybar-layout` |
| **Waybar position** | `top`, `bottom` | `SUPER+SHIFT+/` | `~/.local/state/mango/waybar-position` |

Mode selects the compositor config and autostart set. Layout selects which
waybar modules are shown. Position moves the bar between screen edges. There is
one stylesheet, `style-solid.css` — hud had a second until `docs/adr/0035`, and
was also the one mode that overrode the layout pick.

**Mode also selects the look, and noctalia's is not tiling's.** `tiling` is the
flat set — no animations, no gaps, square corners, a 1px border. `noctalia` overrides all of it after the `source=` lines: 12px corners
matching noctalia's own frame radius, 8/12px gaps, a 2px border, zoom open and
close, and shadows on floating windows. Compositor blur stays off (the amdgpu
freeze, `docs/gotchas.md` → Power), layer shadows and layer animations stay off
for anything `^noctalia-` because the shell draws and animates its own panels.
`docs/adr/0022`.

**`SUPER+/` offers `full`, `focus` and `minimal`, and every one of them is
reachable.** That was not true until `docs/adr/0035`: `hud` was a mode that also
forced its own layout, so a pick made in that mode was stored and then silently
overridden.

**`noctalia` has no waybar at all**, so `SUPER+/` and `SUPER+SHIFT+/` mean
"configure the bar" rather than "configure waybar": in noctalia mode they open
its settings panel and toggle its bar, through `scripts/menus/shell.sh` like
every other mode-dependent key (`docs/adr/0023`). Until 2026-08-16 both simply
refused with a `notify-send` — correct, and still two dead keys out of a set
that small.

`mode_has_waybar()` in `lib.sh` stays, and so do the three guards that call it:
nothing routes a waybar script into noctalia mode any more, but the scripts are
still runnable by hand and a guard that is never reached costs nothing next to
one that was needed and removed. See §6 for the mode, and `docs/adr/0020`.

Waybar configs are generated as the **full layout × position matrix**:
`config-<layout>-<position>.jsonc`, 4 × 2 = 8 files. `waybar-restart.sh` only
builds a filename from the three state values; nothing is rewritten at runtime.

The first two open a rofi picker; position is a **straight toggle**, since
with two options a menu costs more keystrokes than the thing it selects.
`waybar-position.sh` also accepts an explicit `top`/`bottom` argument for
scripting.

All three are read by **`scripts/waybar/waybar-restart.sh`**, which is the only
place that knows how they combine — so login, mode switch, layout switch,
position toggle and `reload_config` all land on the same result.

**The state paths and their defaults live in `scripts/lib.sh`**, sourced by
every script that touches them. Each one used to re-derive
`${XDG_STATE_HOME:-$HOME/.local/state}/mango` and its own fallback value, which
is exactly how the mode switch broke one-way on 2026-07-31 — one reader
disagreed with the writers about the path, silently. `lib.sh` also holds
`apply_mode()`, the body `modes/tiling.sh` and the since-removed `modes/hud.sh`
(`docs/adr/0035`) each used to carry as a byte-identical copy.

> **How position actually works:** waybar takes only `-c`, `-s` and `-b` on the
> command line — `position` is a config key with no flag. So each position is a
> **separate generated file**, and the script picks between them.
>
> `atBottom` in `waybar.nix` only flips `position` now. It also MIRRORED the
> vertical margins until `docs/adr/0035`, which mattered for exactly one layout:
> hud used `"margin-bottom": -28` against a 28px bar to cancel its exclusive
> zone. Restore the mirroring before adding a layout with a vertical margin.
>
> Styling follows automatically — waybar adds its position as a CSS class on the
> window, so `window#waybar.bottom` in `style-solid.css` moves the separator
> line to the top edge.

> All three layouts show the battery relative to the TLP charge limit, so a
> battery parked at the 85% stop threshold reads 100%. The limit is read from
> `services.tlp.settings.STOP_CHARGE_THRESH_BAT0`, not copied. The rescale
> happens before `states` is compared, so `warning = 30` is a real 25.5%.

### Keybinds

`SUPER` is the modifier throughout.

**Launching**

| Key | Action |
|---|---|
| `SUPER+Return` | foot (terminal) |
| `SUPER+SHIFT+Return` | kitty |
| `SUPER+Space` | Launcher — fsel, or noctalia's own in `noctalia` mode |
| `SUPER+=` | Calculator (`rofi -show calc`, result to the clipboard) — rofi in every mode |
| `SUPER+;` | Emoji picker |
| `SUPER+B` | Zen browser |
| `SUPER+E` | Thunar |
| `SUPER+W` | Window switcher (`rofi -show window`) — a picker, unlike `SUPER+Tab`. rofi in **every** mode, incl. noctalia: see §13 |
| `SUPER+V` | Clipboard history |
| `SUPER+P` | Bitwarden — rofi in every mode |
| `SUPER+CTRL+N` / `+B` | Network / Bluetooth |
| `SUPER+CTRL+V` | VPN menu — rofi in every mode |

⚠️ **Nine of these keys change owner with the desktop mode.** They all route
through `scripts/menus/shell.sh`, which holds the one table pairing each action
with a noctalia IPC call and its rofi/swaync equivalent — see §6 and
`docs/adr/0023`. The keys marked "rofi in every mode" stay put for reasons that differ per key:
noctalia's launcher has a calculator but no IPC function to open it directly, no
`rbw` front end at all, and its network panel does not know about the PIA
profiles this repo declares. `SUPER+W` is a third case — noctalia *has*
`launcher windows` and it lists nothing here (§13).

**Windows**

| Key | Action |
|---|---|
| `SUPER+Q` | Close window |
| `SUPER+H/J/K/L` | Focus left/down/up/right |
| `SUPER+SHIFT+H/J/K/L` | Swap window in that direction |
| `SUPER+Tab` / `SUPER+SHIFT+Tab` | Next / previous in stack |
| `ALT+Tab` | Overview |
| `SUPER+F` / `SUPER+SHIFT+F` | Fullscreen / fake fullscreen |
| `SUPER+A` | Maximise to screen |
| `SUPER+SHIFT+O` | Toggle floating |
| `SUPER+I` / `SUPER+SHIFT+I` | Minimise / restore |
| `SUPER+G` | Toggle global (sticky) |
| `ALT+Z` | Scratchpad |
| `SUPER+[` / `SUPER+]` | Spotify / Equibop scratchpad |
| `CTRL+SHIFT+H/J/K/L` | Move a floating window |
| `CTRL+ALT+H/J/K/L` | Resize a floating window |

**Workspaces (tags)**

| Key | Action |
|---|---|
| `SUPER+1…9` | Go to tag |
| `SUPER+SHIFT+1…9` | Move window to tag and follow |
| `SUPER+CTRL+SHIFT+1…9` | Move window to tag silently |
| `SUPER+CTRL+H` / `+L` | Previous / next tag |
| `SUPER+ALT+H` / `+L` | Move window to previous / next tag |

Tags 7 and 9 default to `monocle`; the rest are `tile` (`universal/tag.conf`).

**Layout**

| Key | Action |
|---|---|
| `SUPER+N` | Cycle layout |
| `SUPER+CTRL+Return` | Zoom (promote to master) |
| `SUPER+CTRL+K` / `+J` | More / fewer master windows |
| `SUPER+CTRL+,` / `+.` | Shrink / grow master area |
| `SUPER+SHIFT+X` / `+Z` | More / fewer gaps |
| `SUPER+SHIFT+R` | Toggle gaps |
| `SUPER+X` | Cycle proportion preset |

**System**

| Key | Action |
|---|---|
| `SUPER+R` | Reload mango config |
| `SUPER+/` | Configure the bar — waybar's layout picker, or noctalia's settings panel |
| `SUPER+SHIFT+/` | Waybar top/bottom, or noctalia's bar on/off |
| `SUPER+CTRL+/` | Desktop mode picker |
| `SUPER+SHIFT+N` | Do not disturb |
| `SUPER+SHIFT+S` / `SUPER+Delete` | Lock screen |
| `SUPER+Escape` | Power menu — noctalia's session menu in `noctalia` mode |
| `SUPER+SHIFT+P` | Cycle TLP power profile — every mode. Not ACPI: `platform_profile` is a placebo here (§9, `docs/adr/0017`) |
| `SUPER+SHIFT+A` | Keep awake — holds a Wayland idle inhibitor, the only thing that stops swayidle's ladder from inside the session. `wlinhibit.service` under waybar, quickshell's own in `noctalia` (§9, `docs/adr/0031`) |
| `SUPER+C` | Control centre — thirteen rows in one list (network, bluetooth, VPN, volume, microphone, night light, keep awake, power profile, phone, weather, do-not-disturb, notifications, bar), each showing the state it is actually in, or noctalia's own panel in `noctalia` mode. It is a **reader**: nothing in it changes anything itself, and five rows take their icon and their state from the waybar module that owns the fact (`docs/adr/0033`, `docs/adr/0038`) |
| bar button, every layout | The same control centre, through the same router — `custom/control-center` in `waybar.nix`, `on-click` running `shell.sh control-center`, so the button and the key both reach noctalia's panel in `noctalia` mode |
| `Print` / `CTRL+Print` | Region screenshot / full screen to clipboard |
| `CTRL+ALT+\` / `+Backspace` | Notification panel / clear all |
| `SUPER+SHIFT+CTRL+M` | Quit the compositor |
| Media & brightness keys | Volume, playback, backlight (via wpctl / playerctl / brightnessctl) |
| `XF86AudioMicMute` | Mic mute. Its state is on the bar (waybar's `pulseaudio`) and in the control centre; the ThinkPad LED is no longer the only place it shows |
| Power button | Tap hibernates, hold powers off — logind, not a mango bind (§9) |

**noctalia mode only**

These two have no analogue under waybar and swaync, so they are bound in
`noctalia/bind.conf` and exist only while that mode is selected — a shared bind
would be a key that does nothing and exits 0 in tiling. Both are
panel-shaped rather than list-shaped, which is why they are the two that stayed.

The list has shrunk twice. `SUPER+SHIFT+A` left on 2026-08-18, when the idle
inhibitor got a unit tiling can drive too (`docs/adr/0031`); `SUPER+C`
left on 2026-08-19, when the control centre turned out to need no new state at
all — only a list of the owners that already existed (`docs/adr/0033`).

| Key | Action |
|---|---|
| `SUPER+D` | Calendar |
| `SUPER+SHIFT+D` | Dock |

### Waybar

Status bar. **The layouts are generated by `modules/home/waybar.nix`** — there
are no `config*.jsonc` files in this repo; the eight
`config-<layout>-<position>.jsonc` are written into `~/.config/mango/waybar/`
alongside the hand-written CSS, which stays a file. Each module is defined once
and a layout is a list of names, so a name with no definition is an **eval
error** rather than an empty module. Per-layout divergences live in a `tweaks`
attribute at the call site.

**A layout side is a list of GROUPS, and group order is the same in all three.**
The first module of each group after the first is emitted as `name#sep`, which
waybar renders with the style class `sep` and the sheet's one `.sep` rule draws
the separator — so grouping is declared beside the order rather than inferred
from fifteen module-keyed borders in the CSS. A layout may drop a module but
never reposition one, so `SUPER+/` moves nothing two layouts share;
`checks/static.sh` asserts that, the `.sep` rule's existence, and that no
module-keyed border comes back. `docs/adr/0042`.

Right-hand groups, in order: notification · cpu memory · network vpn bluetooth

Notable custom modules — each is a script under `dotfiles/mango/scripts/`, so if one
is missing from the bar, **run its script by hand first**:

| Module | Script | Refresh signal |
|---|---|---|
| `custom/window` | `waybar/window-title.sh` | streams `mmsg watch focusing-client` |
| `custom/power-profile` | `system/power-profile.sh` | `RTMIN+11` |
| `custom/night-mode` | `menus/night-mode.sh` | `RTMIN+9` |
| `custom/phone` | `kdeconnect/phone-status.sh` | 30 s |
| `custom/weather` | `system/weather.sh` | `RTMIN+13`, plus a 300 s poll (`full` and `focus`) |

> **`phone-status.sh` takes verbs: `status` (the default, so waybar's argument-less
> `exec` still works) and `ring`.** The KDE Connect device id is written **once**,
> in that script — the bar's `on-click` and the control centre's row both call
> `… ring` rather than spelling `kdeconnect-cli -d <id> --ring` again. `ring`
> `notify-send`s when the phone is unreachable instead of failing silently.

> **`weather.sh` takes three verbs and only two may touch the network:**
> `status` (the bar — fetches when the 900 s cache has expired), `read` (the
> control-centre row — cache only, never a socket, because that menu renders in
> parallel and costs its slowest row) and `refresh` (Enter on that row — fetches
> past the cache, then raises `RTMIN+13` so the bar moves too). Coordinates come
> from `local.location` in `modules/home/options.nix` via the generated
> `mango/universal/weather-location.env`; the cache is `$STATE_DIR/weather.json`.
> A reading served from a failed fetch is `class` `stale`, greyed, with its age
> in the tooltip. **`minimal` carries no weather module**, so nothing keeps the
> cache warm there and the control-centre row is normally `stale` until Enter —
> `docs/adr/0038`.
| `custom/power` | — opens wlogout | — |

> **`pulseaudio` is one module showing two devices.** `{format_source}` in its
> `format` — and repeated in `format-muted`, which replaces `format` rather than
> adding to it — is the microphone; `format-source` / `format-source-muted` are
> its two glyphs, and **both are non-empty on purpose**, because an indicator
> that vanishes in one state is indistinguishable from a broken one. No script,
> no `custom/microphone`: PipeWire owns the fact and the bar and the control
> centre are both readers of it (`docs/gotchas.md` → Waybar, `docs/adr/0033`).

> **Do not reintroduce waybar's built-in `dwl/window` module.** mango 0.15.5
> dropped the dwl IPC protocol it binds to, and its absence makes waybar
> segfault at startup. `custom/window` exists for this reason.

### The rest of the stack

| Piece | Role |
|---|---|
| **fsel** | Primary launcher (`SUPER+Space`), floating foot terminal pinned right |
| **rofi** | Every structured menu — bluetooth, clipboard, volume, network, VPN, mode and layout pickers — plus `calc` and `emoji` as plugin modes. No daemon. Config *and* theme in `dotfiles/rofi/config.rasi` (ADR 0021). Grepping for `rofi` also substring-matches `power-profile` |
| **rofi-rbw** | Bitwarden (`SUPER+P`). Not a rofi plugin — a front-end over `rbw` |
| **swaync** | Notifications. Started from `autostart.conf`, **not** systemd — the nixpkgs unit is masked |
| **awww** | Wallpaper daemon (the swww fork; the binary is `awww`) |
| **wlsunset** | Night light, owned by a systemd user unit. `tiling` mode only — `noctalia` mode stops it (`docs/adr/0037`) |
| **wlogout** | Session menu behind the waybar power icon — lock, logout, suspend, hibernate, reboot, shutdown |
| **swaylock** | Screen lock in tiling, and the fallback in noctalia mode (`swaylock-effects`). Needs the hand-declared PAM service in `desktop.nix`; configured by `programs.swaylock` (§9) |
| **lockscreen** | The wrapper every lock path actually calls — hands the lock to noctalia in noctalia mode, otherwise picks a background from the pool and execs swaylock (§9, `docs/adr/0018`, `docs/adr/0024`) |
| **swayidle** | Lock handler *and* idle daemon — `lockscreen` on `before-sleep`/`lock-session`, plus the dim → lock+blank → suspend ladder (§9) |
| **poweralertd** | Low-battery notifications into swaync. `-S` keeps it to power supplies, so headphones don't alert (§9) |
| **KDE Connect** | Phone integration; `kdeconnectd` from autostart |

## 8. Shell, terminals, editors

**zsh is the login shell.** Configured from `~/.config/zsh/conf.d/*.zsh` via
`ZDOTDIR`; `programs.zsh` in `modules/home/shell.nix` owns `~/.zshrc`, the
plugins and history, and sources `conf.d/*.zsh` at the end — so `conf.d`
deliberately wins over home-manager's defaults. **Fish is gone.**

Aliases worth knowing: `cat`→`bat`, `ls`/`ll`/`la`→`eza`, `lf`→`yazi`,
`zed`→`zeditor`, `z` for zoxide jumping. In `~` only, bare `ls` hides a fixed
list of clutter directories; `ll`/`la` are the unfiltered escape hatches.

**Terminals:** foot (default, `SUPER+Return`), kitty, ghostty. All on the selected scheme,
Hack Nerd Font Mono 11 — kitty additionally takes bold and italic from
0xProto Nerd Font Mono (bold-italic stays Hack; 0xProto ships none).
`checks/static.sh` asserts every family named here actually resolves.

⚠️ **kitty and foot are generated** by `programs.kitty` / `programs.foot`, from
the **single palette** in `modules/home/palette.nix` — kitty takes `#rrggbb`,
foot takes bare hex, both from the same attrset, which also feeds the bar and
rofi. There is no `dotfiles/kitty/` or `dotfiles/foot/` in this repo. Change a
colour there, once, and it lands everywhere on the next rebuild.
ghostty has no config at all: `dotfiles/ghostty/config.ghostty` was a zero-byte
file and was deleted rather than converted; the package runs on its defaults,
exactly as it already did.

There is no `active-theme` indirection any more, and it is now *impossible* to
reintroduce as it stood — there is no directory for a mode script to write a
theme into.

**Editors:** Neovim is `$EDITOR`/`$VISUAL`, so it is what git, `sudoedit`,
`systemctl edit`, lazygit and yazi all open. It is a hand-rolled lazy.nvim
config (~18 plugins), and the one large config still hand-written — see
`dotfiles/nvim/README.md`. It is now the only editor this repo configures:
**helix was removed 2026-08-17** (`docs/adr/0027`). Zed is generated too, but by
a module that *merges* into a writable `settings.json` rather than linking it.

⚠️ **nvim ships no language servers.** There is no mason; it takes servers from
`$PATH`, so every server must be declared in `modules/home/packages.nix`. A
missing server is skipped in **silence** — audit with the `command -v` loop in
`docs/gotchas.md` → Editors, or `:checkhealth lsp`, and read the *output*. See
`docs/adr/0007`.

## 9. Hardware behaviour

Three things look like faults and are not.

### Power modes

Three TLP profiles. `SUPER+SHIFT+p` and a left-click on the waybar
leaf/bolt/adjust glyph toggle **balanced ↔ performance** — the two everyday
modes. **Fanless is right-click only**, and left-clicking out of it lands in
balanced. It is kept off the left-click path deliberately: a 1.1 GHz cap with
the iGPU pinned to 200 MHz is too large a penalty to reach by clicking one time
too many.

Right-click returns to whatever the current supply implies — performance on
mains, balanced on battery. It names that explicitly because
`TLP_AUTO_SWITCH=2` holds fanless across a charger change by design, so nothing
reverts it on its own.

| Profile | TLP | Governor / EPP | Max freq | Boost | iGPU | ABM |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| performance | `_ON_AC` | performance / performance | 4.63 GHz | on | auto | 0 |
| balanced | `_ON_BAT` | powersave / power | 4.63 GHz | **off** | auto | 1 |
| fanless | `_ON_SAV` | powersave / power | **1.12 GHz** | off | **low** | 3 |

`fanless` is TLP's `power-saver` (`SAV`). `TLP_AUTO_SWITCH=2` keeps it across a
charger transition, so it holds on mains — that is deliberate, and the tooltip
says so rather than looking like a bug.

⚠️ **"Fanless" is aspirational under sustained all-core load, and measurably
so.** Two `fan-calibrate` runs put the EC trip at ~47–48 °C against an idle
plateau of 40–46 °C depending on ambient; twelve threads cross that even at
418 MHz, the hardware minimum. There is no cap that makes sustained load
silent on this chassis, so the mode targets **bursty** desktop use, where it is
genuinely quiet.

The cap is therefore `lowest_nonlinear` (1115770) — the highest clock still at
minimum core voltage, i.e. the best perf-per-watt point. Efficiency is the
objective only because the thermal one proved unreachable; a lower cap buys
silence it cannot deliver and costs real speed. Details in `docs/adr/0017`.

> The everyday win is **balanced**, not fanless. With boost off and the 2.9 GHz
> base ceiling it idles fan-free at ~40 °C, where the old low-power mode ran at
> 2340 rpm. That is what fixed the original complaint.

> `platform_profile` moves with the profile but is not what does the work — it
> is a firmware hint and is identical across all three for everything the
> scheduler reads. Don't diagnose from it.

ABM 3 visibly shifts panel contrast; that is the mode working, not a display
fault. The iGPU pin costs compositor smoothness — 200 MHz against a 1899 MHz top
state — and is the first thing to relax if fanless feels sluggish.

#### The same three profiles over D-Bus

`power-profiles-tlp` owns `org.freedesktop.UPower.PowerProfiles` and answers it
from TLP, so clients written against power-profiles-daemon drive these three
profiles rather than finding no service. Reads come from `/run/tlp/last_pwr`,
writes go through `power-mode`, and a switch TLP makes on its own — a charger
transition — is pushed out as `PropertiesChanged`. `docs/adr/0026`.

```
busctl get-property org.freedesktop.UPower.PowerProfiles \
  /org/freedesktop/UPower/PowerProfiles \
  org.freedesktop.UPower.PowerProfiles ActiveProfile
```

The visible consumer is **noctalia's control-centre power button**
(`SUPER+CTRL+C`), which is in its shipped default shortcut row and was greyed
out until this existed. ⚠️ **It cycles balanced → performance → fanless**, so a
third click lands on the 1.1 GHz cap — deliberate on noctalia's part, accepted
here because it names the profile in a toast. `SUPER+SHIFT+P` gets back to
balanced.

Two things it deliberately does not do. **Profile holds are declined** with a
`NotSupported` error rather than recorded and ignored, so no application can pin
a profile behind you. And **it refuses to start** when TLP reports no profile,
rather than publishing a guess; `BindsTo=tlp.service` means a stopped TLP takes
the bus name with it. Both failures land in `systemctl status
power-profiles-tlp`.

> noctalia's **battery-panel slider** is a separate control and is off by
> default. It is a per-instance setting on the Battery *bar widget*, so enabling
> it in the seed would mean owning noctalia's whole bar layout — turn it on in
> noctalia's settings panel instead (Bar → Battery → show power profiles).

### Battery stops below 100%

TLP sets EC thresholds **START 75 / STOP 85** (`modules/system/power.nix`,
confirmed against live sysfs). On AC the battery parks wherever it is and only
tops up below 75%. `status` then reads `Not charging`, which waybar renders as
a **plug** icon rather than a lightning bolt. A plug with a static sub-100%
reading is the hysteresis working.

Raising STOP does not trigger a charge — the EC only starts below START. To
force one: `sudo tlp setcharge 84 85 BAT0`.

> `upower -i` reports `charge-start-threshold: 75%` regardless of the real
> value. Trust `/sys/class/power_supply/BAT0/charge_control_*_threshold`.

> The bar shows the **raw** percentage. `full-at`, which rescaled it so the 85%
> stop read as 100%, was removed on 2026-08-09 — it made the bar disagree with
> `upower` and sysfs by a constant factor, and that masked two reports of the
> module freezing. `checks/static.sh` asserts no generated config carries it.
> Consequence: on AC the bar parks at 85% and never reads 100%.

### Suspend and s0i3

The firmware exposes only **s2idle** (`/sys/power/mem_sleep` → `[s2idle]`), not
S3 — so `mem_sleep_default=deep` would achieve nothing. Under s2idle the SoC
only reaches its low-power state (**s0i3**) once every IP block reports idle.

**A lit panel during suspend is a battery bug, not a cosmetic one.** The
DISPLAY block tracks the display *pipe*, so a screen left on holds s0i3 off
entirely and the machine idles at **~4.1 W** through what looks like sleep.
That is how the laptop was found flat after a night closed on the desk.

Fixed with `powerManagement.powerDownCommands`/`resumeCommands` in `power.nix`,
running **`wlopm --off '*'`** / `--on` through the shared `setDisplayPower`
helper. The resume hook is the load-bearing half: an output left in its off
power-mode is not restored by input, so dropping it wakes the machine to a
black screen no keypress fixes. `wlopm` needs the Wayland socket, so it cannot
run as root directly — the helper loops over `/run/user/*/wayland-[0-9]` and
`runuser`s to the owning user.

⚠️ **The backlight cannot do this job.** `brightnessctl` and `bl_power` only
drive PWM; the DISPLAY block tracks the CRTC. Hooks written that way succeed,
exit 0, and leave the panel lit and the battery draining.

**Result: fixed.** A 9h37m lid-closed suspend on battery cost **4 percentage
points** (58% → 54% of a 42.4 Wh cell) — about **0.15 W**, which is s0i3. That
retracts the earlier reading here: blanking the display was measured as taking
suspend from 4.10 W only to ~3.03 W, with `last_hw_sleep` still 0, and this
section concluded s0i3 was unreachable for unknown reasons. It is reachable.
The short instrumented measurements were the unreliable part, not the fix — a
long sleep measured by battery percentage either side is the honest test, and
the only one that matched what the machine actually does overnight.

Hibernation on the lid stays regardless: it is there for the resume hang and the
spurious wake (§below), not for the drain.

**The same pre-sleep hook also un-throttles.** After `setDisplayPower "off"`,
`powerDownCommands` enables `cpufreq/boost`, writes each policy's
`cpuinfo_max_freq` into its `scaling_max_freq`, and returns the iGPU to DPM
`auto` — so nothing throttled enters a sleep. The reason is hibernation's entry
phase: it preallocates ~5.8 GiB and compresses into zram *before* it can
snapshot, measured at 7 s at full clock against 22 s capped, and a lid reopened
inside that window hung the machine outright (`docs/gotchas.md` → Power).
Order matters — with boost off the driver clamps `cpuinfo_max_freq` to the
2901000 nominal, so boost must be lifted before the ceiling is read. There is no
restore half: `tlp suspend` touches only AHCI and PCIe ASPM, and `tlp resume`
reapplies the AC/BAT profile on the way back. It runs for suspend too, where the
entry phase is too short to matter, because one hook on `sleep.target` beats a
second unit that has to tell the two apart.

> `/sys/kernel/debug/amd_pmc/smu_fw_info` **first** — it names the offending IP
> block directly, in one command.

### Idle

Until 2026-08-11 nothing acted on idleness at all: swayidle carried **no
timeouts**, so with the lid open the machine never dimmed, never locked and
never slept — 6.9 W until the 3% hibernate, roughly six hours, with the desktop
unlocked the whole time. That gap dwarfed every other power setting on this
machine.

The ladder now, all in `services.swayidle`:

| Idle | What happens | Undone by |
|---|---|---|
| 4 min | `brightnessctl -s set 10%` — dim, as the warning | `brightnessctl -r` on activity |
| 5 min | `lockscreen -f`, then `wlopm --off '*'` | `wlopm --on '*'` on activity |
| 30 min | `idle-suspend` — suspends only on battery, and only if no MPRIS player reports `Playing` | any input, instantly |

Three things make it safe rather than annoying:

- mango advertises `zwp_idle_inhibit_manager_v1`, so mpv and Firefox suppress
  the whole ladder during playback. Check with `wayland-info | grep inhibit`
  before assuming that of any compositor.
- The lock/blank step is joined with `;`, **not `&&`** — see `docs/gotchas.md`.
- `idle-suspend` is a `writeShellApplication`, so it is shellchecked at build
  time rather than being an inline string nothing gates.

On AC the ladder stops after the blank: locked, dark, and still up.

Playback is handled at two different levels, deliberately:

- **Video** needs nothing from us. mpv and Firefox hold a `zwp_idle_inhibit`
  surface while playing, which stops the ladder before the first rung — no dim,
  no lock, no sleep.
- **Audio-only** (ncspot, Spotify, a music tab) usually takes no inhibitor, so
  the ladder runs. That is wanted for the first two rungs — dimming and locking
  over an album is correct — but not for the last, so `idle-suspend` alone
  checks `playerctl --all-players status` and bails on `Playing`. `Paused` and
  `Stopped` sleep.

⚠️ **`systemd-inhibit --what=idle` does not hold any of this off.** swayidle
takes its idle signal from `ext_idle_notifier_v1`, i.e. from the compositor, and
mango does not bridge logind's inhibitors into it. So an unattended long build on
battery still hits the 30-minute suspend — it resumes where it left off, but
network connections will not. Same for anything playing audio without an MPRIS
interface: a game, a call in an app that publishes none.

#### Holding the ladder off — keep awake

**`SUPER+SHIFT+A`, or click the bar's `custom/idle-inhibitor`** (`full` and
`focus` layouts, between night mode and the power profile). 󰒲 means the ladder
is live; 󰒳 in yellow means nothing dims, locks or sleeps.

Both run `scripts/system/idle-inhibit.sh toggle`, which starts or stops
**`wlinhibit.service`**. That unit holds a `zwp_idle_inhibit_manager_v1`
inhibitor — the mechanism mpv and Firefox use, the one mango feeds into
`wlr_idle_notifier_v1_set_inhibited`, and the only one that reaches swayidle at
all. **No timeout, ever**: an inhibitor that silently expires part-way through is
the failure it exists to prevent.

The unit is the state. It survives `waybar-reload`, both bar switches, a switch
to `minimal` (which does not carry the module) and both desktop modes;
it ends with the session and not before. Nothing starts it at login.

This used to be waybar's built-in `idle_inhibitor`, whose state was a bool in
the bar process — clickable and nothing else, and released by every one of those
events without a word. docs/adr/0031.

⚠️ **Red 󰒳 means the unit FAILED and the ladder is live.** The state lives
outside the bar now, so the bar reports rather than holds: `systemctl --user
status wlinhibit`.

**Switching to noctalia releases it.** noctalia holds keep-awake over
quickshell's own `IdleInhibitor` and exposes no way to read that state back, so
`apply_mode` hands over rather than leave two inhibitors and one honest
indicator: one owner per mode, with a notification when it actually released
something. `SUPER+SHIFT+A` re-arms it in noctalia. Coming back out does **not**
restore it — the handover is one-way, because noctalia's IPC cannot be asked
what it is holding.

`systemctl --user stop swayidle` (and `start` after) remains the bigger hammer:
it stops the ladder rather than inhibiting it.

### Locking

`services.swayidle` in `modules/home/default.nix` runs `lockscreen -f` on
`before-sleep`, on `lock`, and on the 5-minute idle timeout above. Before it
existed, swaylock was reachable only by hand (`SUPER+Delete`, `SUPER+SHIFT+s`,
the wlogout button) and **every lid-close resumed straight to the unlocked
desktop**.

**Which locker you get follows the desktop mode** (`docs/adr/0024`). In tiling
it is swaylock, as it always was. In `noctalia` mode, with the unit
running, `lockscreen` asks the shell for its own lock screen first — the same
one `SUPER+Delete` opens — waits a second, and then runs swaylock anyway.
swaylock exits non-zero exactly when something else already holds the
`ext-session-lock-v1` lock, so that last step is simultaneously the fallback and
the *proof* that the session is locked. Neither outcome can leave it unlocked;
only which lock screen you see is at stake.

swayidle rather than another `powerManagement` hook, for two reasons:

- It holds a **logind sleep inhibitor** — `-w` makes it wait for `lockscreen -f`
  to fork, and swaylock forks only once the lock surface is up. So the lock is
  guaranteed present before the suspend, not racing it. In noctalia mode the
  same promise is kept by the failing swaylock above, which cannot fail until
  the compositor has confirmed the session locked.
- A root sleep hook runs inside `sleep-actions.service`, whose cgroup is
  **killed when the unit stops on resume** — taking the swaylock it just
  started with it. That leaves the compositor locked with no client, which
  `ext-session-lock-v1` makes unrecoverable (§13).

Ordering falls out of this: swayidle's inhibitor puts the lock up first, then
`sleep-actions` powers the panel down.

`lock`/`unlock` mean `loginctl lock-session` works too.

#### What it looks like, and why

`programs.swaylock` generates `~/.config/swaylock/config`, which **every lock
path reads** — all of them run `lockscreen -f`, which execs swaylock and passes
no `--config`.

`clock` + `indicator` are the point of it: a swaylock screen with nothing drawn
on it is indistinguishable from a machine that is off or hung, so the lock now
shows a **ticking clock inside a permanently visible indicator ring**. The clock
is the proof of life; the ring is where typing lands. `indicator-idle-visible`
keeps the ring up rather than fading it out.

Both options are **swaylock-effects extensions**, which is why the module sets
`package = null` — see the trap in `docs/gotchas.md`.

This replaced three separate copies of the same theme: `mango/tiling/swaylock.conf`,
the same file under the since-removed `mango/hud/`, and an **untracked** hand-written
`~/.config/swaylock/config` that had been quietly supplying the theme to every
bare `swaylock -f` all along. The per-mode files are deleted; there is one lock
screen.

#### The background

The flat `#282828` was the same failure the clock fixes — nothing drawn is
nothing to distinguish from a dead machine. It is now a **blocky neutral
texture, with a different pattern on every lock** (`docs/adr/0018`).

| | |
|---|---|
| `pkgs/lock-backgrounds` | 24 PNGs at native 1920×1200, fixed seeds. 160×150px blocks, nine neutral shades of `#282828`, no block matching any neighbour |
| `pkgs/lockscreen` | picks one with `$RANDOM`, execs `swaylock -i`. Empty pool falls back to the solid `color` |
| `programs.swaylock` | sets `scaling = "fill"`; deliberately sets **no** `image` — the wrapper supplies it per lock |

**Every lock path calls `lockscreen`, not `swaylock`** — swayidle's
`before-sleep`/`lock` and its idle timeout, wlogout, `power-menu.sh`, and the
`SUPER+Delete` / `SUPER+SHIFT+s` binds. It is not named `swaylock` because that
would shadow swaylock-effects in PATH, the same trap `package = null` exists
for. `checks/static.sh` asserts swayidle reaches it and that its pool is
non-empty — an empty pool is invisible, since the fallback is the old flat
colour.

Why a pool rather than generating per lock: swayidle's `before-sleep` hook
blocks suspend until it exits, so a PNG encode there risks a late or missing
lock for a difference nobody can see.

### Hibernation

A closed lid **hibernates**, on both power sources. There is no suspend phase
and no `HibernateDelaySec`, so a short lid-close costs a ~6 GiB write and a
~10–30 s resume rather than returning instantly.

**Docked is the exception and stays `ignore`**, so clamshell work on an external
display keeps running. Closing the lid docked therefore leaves the session awake
*and unlocked* — accepted, because the alternative locks you out of the external
screen you are working on.

**Undocking with the lid still shut hibernates, and so locks.** This is logind's
own behaviour, not something configured here: a lid close installs an
`sd_event_add_post` handler that re-runs the lid decision after every event-loop
iteration for as long as the lid stays closed (`button_recheck`,
`logind-button.c`). Losing the display drops `manager_is_docked_or_external_displays()`
to false, so the re-check falls through to `HandleLidSwitch`/`…ExternalPower` —
hibernate — and that goes via `PrepareForSleep`, so swayidle's `before-sleep`
locks first. Verified against systemd 261; the repo's own `HoldoffTimeoutSec`
observation in `docs/adr/0015` is the same re-check seen after a resume.

Two edges of that mechanism worth knowing:

- The re-check passes `is_edge = false`, and `manager_handle_action` **returns
  early for `HANDLE_LOCK` when `!is_edge`**. So `lock` is an edge-only action:
  as a docked lid value it would fire once on close and never re-fire. Sleep
  actions have no such guard, which is why the undock path works.
- `HoldoffTimeoutSec` (30 s) suppresses lid handling right after startup or
  resume — deliberately, to let USB docks settle before their displays are
  counted. An undock inside that window waits it out.

**So does a tap on the power key**, with a long press left as `poweroff`. The
systemd defaults are the other way round — a brushed button ended the session
with no prompt, and holding it did nothing — which is the one power-management
default on this machine that could lose work.

Three routes into hibernation, then: the lid, the power key, and upower at 3%
(below). The 30-minute idle rung used to be a fourth and **suspends** now —
`docs/adr/0016` has why the lid evidence does not transfer to it, and why
upower's 3% action is what makes an unattended idle suspend safe.

That instant resume is what `suspend-then-hibernate` bought, and it was tried
twice — first with AC on a plain `suspend`, then with s-t-h on both sources. Both
lost the same way: a spurious wake ends the s-t-h cycle, and logind's lid
re-check ~30 s later degrades to a plain `suspend` with no hibernate timer
behind it, leaving the machine in the long s2idle its resume hangs from. Removing
the suspend phase removes the wake that starts it. `docs/gotchas.md` → Power has
the journal signature.

The image goes to the 20 GiB swapfile on `@swap` (§1). **zram remains the
working swap** at priority 5 against the file's −1, so ordinary swapping never
touches the disk — the file exists only to hold an image zram cannot, being
itself in the RAM being saved.

**A dying battery hibernates too**, via upower rather than logind:
`criticalPowerAction = "Hibernate"` at `percentageAction = 3`. NixOS defaults to
`HybridSleep`, which writes the image and then *stays in s2idle* — the session
survives, but the machine is still drawing at the one moment it must not. The
~3 W once measured for that state came from the same short-measurement batch as
the retracted s0i3 figure and should not be quoted; the argument does not need
it, since any suspend at 3% is the wrong state to be in.

3% is one point above upower's default, not a safety cushion: 1% is 0.42 Wh
here, worth ~60 s at the ~25 W a hibernate write draws, against a write that
takes ~30 s. The extra point covers the poll interval at this battery's 38 W
recorded peak. **The gauge is accurate this low** — it has logged 1% repeatedly,
so there is no firmware cliff to stay clear of, and a larger margin only costs
runtime.

⚠️ **`percentageLow`/`Critical`/`Action` must stay strictly descending** (20 >
5 > 3). Out of order or otherwise invalid, upower discards all three and uses
its own defaults — the action still fires, just at a charge nobody chose, and
nothing logs. Read back `/etc/UPower/UPower.conf`, not the Nix.

⚠️ **`resume_offset` is the fragile part, and getting it wrong fails silently.**
Both `boot.resumeDevice` and `boot.kernelParams = [ "resume_offset=…" ]` are
required: one names the filesystem, the other locates the image inside it. Get
it wrong and the machine simply boots fresh and discards the session, which
presents as "hibernate didn't work" rather than "resume was misconfigured". The
number is valid only for the exact file that exists now — recreating, resizing,
defragmenting or `balance`-ing it moves the image. Re-derive with:

```
sudo btrfs inspect-internal map-swapfile -r /swap/swapfile
```

⚠️ **A rebuild is not enough — you must REBOOT.** `resume=` is a kernel command
line parameter, so `rebuild` writes the new logind and sleep config while the
*running* kernel has neither. `systemctl hibernate` then snapshots memory,
prepares S4 and returns **without writing an image or powering off** — and
because the screen blanks and comes back, it reads as a fast, successful
hibernate. It is not. This is dangerous while half-applied, because the lid
handler goes live at rebuild time: closing the lid then attempts the failed
hibernate, thaws, and leaves the machine awake with the lid shut, draining
*faster* than plain suspend. **Reboot promptly after the rebuild.**

⚠️ **The kernel log cannot tell you whether a hibernate succeeded.** The memory
image is snapshotted *before* the write and power-off, so a successful and a
refused attempt leave byte-identical traces. Do not conclude from
`Waking up from system sleep state S4` that anything worked, and in particular
do not set `HibernateMode=shutdown` on that misreading — that was tried and
reverted. What actually distinguishes them:

| Check | Meaning |
|---|---|
| Machine physically powers off; firmware screen on the way back | It really hibernated. **This is the primary signal** |
| `journalctl --list-boots` — boot ID unchanged across the cycle | Resume worked, session restored |
| A new boot ID | Image written but resume failed — session discarded |
| No power-off, journal continuous | Aborted. Check `grep -o 'resume[^ ]*' /proc/cmdline` shows **both** parameters |

> **RTC trap:** `rtc0` here is `acpi-tad` and has no `wakealarm`, so `rtcwake`
> fails with `not enabled for wakeup events` and looks like broken firmware.
> The alarm actually comes from **`rtc1` (`rtc_cmos`)**. Don't point anything
> at `rtc0` to "fix" it.

### WiFi dies after resume

The `ath11k_pci` driver does not cleanly reinitialise on resume; NM retries but
DHCP times out. Two independent layers fix it, and both are needed:

- **TLP** disables WiFi power saving on AC and battery — covers normal runtime
- **`systemd.services.wifi-resume`** cycles the radio 3 s after wake — this is
  what actually fixes the resume failure

Both are declarative (`networking.nix`, `power.nix`). If it recurs, check
`journalctl -u NetworkManager` for a DHCP timeout after wake.

### VPN — autoconnect is off, deliberately

Nine profiles (`homelab` WireGuard + 8 PIA OpenVPN exits) all came off the
backup with `autoconnect=yes`. **All nine were turned off. Do not turn them back
on.** `homelab` auto-activated, claimed the default route, and pushed DNS
`192.168.1.5` onto every link — so away from the home LAN, *all* name
resolution failed. Nothing identifies itself as a VPN problem at that point; it
presents as total DNS death.

Bring it up by hand when away from home: `nmcli connection up homelab`. On
`192.168.1.0/24` the Gitea host (`192.168.1.200`) is reachable directly and the
tunnel is not involved.

| `wlsunset` | Night light — reads its temperature from `~/.local/state/mango/night-temp`. **`Restart=always`**, because noctalia SIGTERMs it on every start and systemd counts that as a clean exit (`docs/gotchas.md` → night light). **Stopped on every entry into `noctalia` mode**, which cannot reach it, and not restarted on the way out (`docs/adr/0037`) |
| `micmute-led` | Syncs the mic-mute LED with PipeWire. **The only place `pactl` exists** — it comes from this unit's `path`, not `systemPackages`. No longer the sole mic indicator: waybar's `pulseaudio` carries `{format_source}` since 2026-08-19, so this unit failing is now visible rather than silent (`docs/gotchas.md` → Waybar) |
| `nextcloud-client` | Cloud sync — credentials in gnome-keyring's `Default` collection, config at `~/.config/Nextcloud/`. If it asks you to log in, check the unit's `XDG_CONFIG_HOME` before anything else (`docs/gotchas.md` → Session environment) |
| `cliphist` (+ `cliphist-images`) | Clipboard history behind `SUPER+V` — read by rofi, and by noctalia's own clipboard view in `noctalia` mode |
| `noctalia` | The `noctalia` desktop mode's shell — bar, notifications, panels. **Started only by that mode's autostart**, never at login; `PartOf` the session target. `Restart=on-failure` with a start limit, so it can wedge: `scripts/modes/noctalia-start.sh` clears that on every entry (`docs/adr/0022`) |
| `mango-session.target` | A marker other units can hang off; started from `autostart.conf` |
| `swaync.service` | **Masked** — autostart owns swaync instead |

`~/.config/systemd/user/` now contains **only** home-manager symlinks into the
store. Keep it that way: it overrides `/etc/systemd/user/`, so any hand-written
file there silently shadows the unit the flake generates.

⚠️ **One owner per daemon.** nixpkgs packages ship user units that Arch's did
not, and they auto-start. swaync raced its own autostart line for a week
before anyone noticed. When adding a package with a daemon, check
`ls $(nix eval --raw nixpkgs#foo)/share/systemd/user/` before assuming
autostart is the only owner. See `docs/adr/0005`.

⚠️ **`Restart=` without `StartLimitBurst=` is a loaded gun.** A misconfigured
rclone unit retried every 5 s until Proton returned an account-level abuse
restriction — the damage landed on the account, not the machine. Any unit that
talks to a remote API needs a start limit. See `docs/adr/0006`.

## 11. What is *not* in this repo

The flake reproduces the system. It does **not** reproduce your data. These
live only on `@home` or in root-owned system directories, survived the
migration by luck of the shared subvolume, and need separate backup:

| What | Where | Size |
|---|---|---|
| Zen browser profile | `~/.config/zen/` | **912 MB** — 13 extensions, logins, history. Growing |
| NetworkManager profiles | `/etc/NetworkManager/system-connections` | the ~29 ordinary APs, root-only, mode 600. The nine credential-bearing ones are declared — ADR 0013 |
| Bluetooth pairings | `/var/lib/bluetooth` | 7 devices |
| Wallpaper | `~/.local/share/mango/wallpaper.png` | 4.6 MB |
| Runtime state | `~/.local/state/mango/` | mode, layout, night-temp, last-vpn |
| **age private key** | `/var/lib/sops-nix/key.txt` | **189 bytes, in no repo — losing it makes `secrets/secrets.yaml` unreadable** |
| CLI credentials | `~/.config/{gh,glab-cli,gpu-screen-recorder,opencode,rclone,rbw,tea}` | gitignored by name |
| corectrl profiles | `~/.config/corectrl/` | written by its GUI |

Snapper covers `/home` against accidental deletion, but snapshots are on the
same disk — they are not a backup.

**Secrets moved into sops-nix on 2026-08-06** (ADR 0012). `secrets/secrets.yaml`
is encrypted and tracked; the PIA credentials, the `homelab` WireGuard key and
the `gh`/`glab`/`tea` tokens all live there. Edit with
`nix develop -c sops secrets/secrets.yaml` **from the repo root**.

⚠️ What replaced that gap is a smaller, sharper one: **the age key at
`/var/lib/sops-nix/key.txt` is a single point of failure in no backup.** Keep a
copy in Bitwarden and on the offline drive.

**The nine credential-bearing NetworkManager profiles moved into the flake on
2026-08-09** (ADR 0013) — `homelab` plus the eight PIA exits, with credentials
substituted from a sops template at activation. The ~29 ordinary access points
stay in NetworkManager's own state, which is a decision rather than a TODO:
`ensureProfiles` deletes nothing, so declaring a subset is supported.

> **Zen note:** there are two profiles in `~/.config/zen/` and only one is real
> (`kxsz4wom.Default (release)`, 839 MB). Which is default is selected
> per-installation by executable path, and that path became a store path at the
> migration — so Zen fell back to the legacy `Default=1` flag, which sat on the
> empty profile. Fixed by moving `Default=1` onto `[Profile0]`. **Do not "fix"
> it by adding an `[Install<hash>]` entry** — the store path changes on every
> Zen update, which would orphan the setting again.

## 12. Troubleshooting

Nearly every problem on this system fails **silently**. The catalogue:

| Symptom | Likely cause | Check |
|---|---|---|
| A waybar module is missing from the bar | Its script exited 127, or emitted an empty `text` | Run the script by hand. An empty custom module is indistinguishable from an absent one |
| `bad interpreter`, exit 127 | `#!/bin/bash` — **there is no `/bin/bash`**, `/bin` holds only `sh` | Use `#!/usr/bin/env bash` |
| A mango script "succeeds" but does nothing | Old dwl-era `mmsg -s -d` flags. `mmsg` takes verbs (`get`, `dispatch`, `watch`) and returns `{"error":...}` **with exit 0** | `mmsg dispatch <func>`, and check the output |
| Icons render as empty boxes | The font lacks that codepoint, or a CSS `url()` failed — GTK draws its missing-image box **without logging** | `fc-list ':charset=XXXX' family` |
| An icon is off-centre in its cell | Container wider than its content, filled from one end — glyph advance vs ink, or `min-width` vs `icon-size` | Compare the two numbers |
| Duplicate/leaked daemon processes | `pkill -x` against a nixpkgs wrapper — `comm` is `.kdeconnectd-wr` (truncated at 15 chars), not `kdeconnectd` | `pkill -f 'bin/kdeconnectd$'` |
| A user unit misbehaves in an Arch-like way | `~/.config/systemd/user/` shadows `/etc/systemd/user/` | Now clean — contains only home-manager symlinks. Keep it that way |
| Lock screen rejects the correct password | Missing `/etc/pam.d/swaylock` → PAM falls through to `other` = deny | `pam_warn(swaylock:auth)` in the journal. Declared in `desktop.nix` |
| Session blank after killing swaylock | `ext-session-lock-v1` **requires** the compositor to stay locked if the client dies. Not a bug | Relaunch swaylock on the same `WAYLAND_DISPLAY` and authenticate, or reboot |
| Total DNS failure | A VPN holding `Default Route: yes` and pushing an unreachable nameserver | `resolvectl status` |
| Rebuild aborts on a file conflict | Two packages owning the same path in `buildEnv` | `lib.hiPrio` on the **winner** — `lowPrio` on the loser silently does nothing when priorities are equal |
| A `/usr/share/...` path doesn't exist | `share/<pkgname>` is not in `environment.pathsToLink` | Vendor the asset and reference it relatively |

**General method:** run the failing thing by hand, in your own shell, and look
at both its output *and* its exit code. Almost every bug in this catalogue was
invisible in logs and reported as "X is missing".

## 13. Known rough edges

Things that are true today and worth knowing. *(Reviewed 2026-08-20.)*

- **noctalia mode wears `nord`; tiling wears `gruvbox`** — set in
  `modules/home/modes.nix` (`docs/adr/0034`). Following the mode: mango's window
  chrome, noctalia's own palette, Equibop's theme filename, and kitty, foot,
  rofi and ncspot through a runtime symlink. **Not** following it, permanently:
  GTK and Qt widget art, the icon set and nvim, which are built artefacts and
  wear `modules/home/scheme.nix` for the whole machine. A mode that names a
  different scheme therefore gets a GTK file dialog in the machine's scheme
  inside that mode's chrome. Both modes name `heartbox` today, so the question
  does not arise; set them apart and it does.
- **foot and ncspot keep their old colours until restarted** across a mode
  switch. foot 1.27 has no config re-read at all — `SIGUSR1`/`SIGUSR2` only pick
  between sections it already loaded — so the swap reaches new windows only;
  ncspot reads `config.toml` once at startup. The mode switch notification names
  whichever is running; `docs/gotchas.md` → Theming has the detail. kitty
  reloads in place, and rofi re-reads on every launch.

- **noctalia mode has no night light, and entering it turns tiling's off.**
  Neither of wlsunset's controls — the bar module, the control centre — runs
  there, and noctalia's own night light is pinned off because wlsunset holds the
  gamma control. So the mode ends it on every entry and notifies; it stays off
  when you switch back, one click from the bar (`docs/adr/0037`).

- **Nothing here can hold off the idle ladder except a Wayland idle inhibitor.**
  `systemd-inhibit --what=idle` does not reach swayidle, so unattended work on
  battery meets the 30-minute suspend. `SUPER+SHIFT+A` is the in-session answer
  and it now survives a waybar restart (docs/adr/0031); `systemctl --user stop
  swayidle` is still the one nothing in the desktop can undo behind you. See §9.
- **The spurious s2idle wake source is still unidentified**, and it is what keeps
  `suspend-then-hibernate` off the lid. Standing suspect: the Synaptics
  fingerprint reader — at `1-3`, the *only* device on USB bus 1, with its own
  `power/wakeup` disabled but its parent XHCI controller `0000:74:00.3`
  `enabled`. Disabling wakeup on that controller costs nothing (there is nothing
  else behind it) and is untried. Since 2026-08-12 the idle rung suspends, so
  the machine finally produces samples to test it against — see
  `docs/adr/0016`.
- ⚠️ **noctalia's Workspace and ActiveWindow widgets render nothing, and the
  Workspace widget is the centre of its bar.** Found 2026-08-16 by reading the
  running system rather than the config. `MangoService.qml` *is* selected —
  the log says `Initializing MangoWC/DWL compositor integration (DWL protocol)`
  — but every one of its paths is guarded on `DwlIpc.available`, and
  `rebuildWorkspaces()` and `updateWindows()` both return early when it is
  false. It is false permanently: quickshell probes for the Wayland global
  `zdwl_ipc_manager_v2`, and mango 0.16.0 creates no such thing (its
  `protocols/` holds three `wlr-*` XML files and no dwl IPC; `mmsg`'s JSON
  socket is a different interface entirely). The tell is one line at startup:

  ```sh
  journalctl --user -u noctalia | grep 'DWL is not available'
  ```

  **This corrects `docs/adr/0020`**, which recorded mango support as working and
  named this exact failure as the thing that support avoided. Nothing to be done
  short of writing a QML widget against `mmsg watch` — noctalia's plugin system
  is the other route and it clones git repositories at runtime, which 0020
  rejected. Tag state is still reachable from waybar in tiling mode.

  **The same dead path empties `CompositorService.windows`**, which is what
  `MangoService.updateWindows()` assigns, so anything reading the window list
  is inert too: the launcher's own window switcher (`launcher windows`) opens
  and lists nothing. That is why `SUPER+W` is `rofi -show window` in every mode
  including noctalia (`docs/adr/0023`). **The dock is fine** — it reads
  `ToplevelManager` (wlr-foreign-toplevel) directly, which mango does
  advertise, so `SUPER+SHIFT+D` works. When adding a noctalia widget or key,
  check which of the two it reads: `CompositorService` is dead here,
  `ToplevelManager` is live.
- **noctalia's session-menu logout is inert**, because `MangoService.logout()`
  shells out to `mmsg -s -q` — the dwl-era flag form mango answers with
  `{"error":"unknown command"}` and exit 0. The button is disabled in
  `settings-pinned.json` rather than left to do nothing (`docs/adr/0023`).
- ~~**Its power-profile widget does nothing**~~ — **closed 2026-08-17.** It
  drove `org.freedesktop.UPower.PowerProfiles`, which was unowned here because
  TLP displaces power-profiles-daemon (`docs/adr/0017`). `power-profiles-tlp`
  now owns that name and answers it from TLP, so the control-centre button is
  live in every mode's clients — §9 and `docs/adr/0026`. The battery-panel
  slider is a separate, off-by-default control; §9 says how to turn it on.
- **Two more things in noctalia mode are inert, and each looks like a bug.**
  Measured by running the shell against a scratch config on 2026-08-14, not
  predicted. Its **blur-behind is silently ignored**: mango does not
  implement `ext-background-effect-v1`, and the setting stays on in the UI
  regardless. And it **fetches its version and contributor list from GitHub** on
  first run and on cache expiry, gated by no setting at all — those calls fail
  with `Moved Permanently` on 4.7.7 anyway, because `curl -s` does not follow
  the redirect left by the upstream repo rename. `general.showChangelogOnStartup`
  and `plugins.notifyUpdates` are off in the seed, but they suppress the popup
  and the nag, **not** the fetch.
- **The age key is a single point of failure.** `/var/lib/sops-nix/key.txt` is
  in no repo and no backup; without it `secrets/secrets.yaml` is unreadable.
  See §11.
- ~~Helix has no Python type checking~~ — **moot 2026-08-17.** Helix was
  removed (`docs/adr/0027`); `pyright` serves nvim, which asked for it.
- ~~Nothing gates a rebuild~~ — **closed 2026-08-03.** `nix flake check` now
  builds `system.build.toplevel` and the home-manager activation package, so
  `buildEnv` collisions and failing derivations surface before a `switch`.
  `verify-packages.sh` was retired as a strict subset of it.
- ~~`nix fmt` uses the unmaintained `nixpkgs-fmt`~~ — **closed 2026-08-03**,
  now `nixfmt` (RFC 166).
- **The `.nix` files are comment-heavy** — 1,346 of 3,506 lines. `dotfiles.nix`
  is 54 lines of code under 249 lines of prose. Much of it duplicates
  `docs/adr/`, which is where the narrative belongs.
- **`~/arch-residue-backup-2026-07-30/`** (2.1 MB) is still in the home
  directory and can be deleted.
