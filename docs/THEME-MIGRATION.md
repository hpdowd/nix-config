# Migrating the theme

How to change what this machine looks like, given the arrangement `docs/adr/0028`
put in place. Written as a runbook because the work splits into two halves that
fail in completely different ways, and the second half is the one people forget.

Companion reading: `docs/SYSTEM.md` §6 (where config lives),
`docs/gotchas.md` → Theming (what has already bitten us), `docs/adr/0028` (why
it is arranged this way).

---

## 0. Decide which kind of change this is

The two cases need different amounts of work, and conflating them is how a
migration ends up half-done and looking deliberate.

> Worked example: this repo went gruvbox → Catppuccin Mocha on 2026-08-18, which
> is a **new scheme** — every row in the right-hand column below actually
> happened. `docs/WORK-LOG.md` has what it cost.

> **Switching between schemes that ALREADY EXIST is one line.** Edit
> `modules/home/scheme.nix`, `nix flake check`, `rebuild`, reload per §5. Four
> schemes ship: `mocha`, `mocha-high-contrast`, `gruvbox`, `nord`.
> Everything below is about bringing a *new* one in.

| | **Recolour** | **New scheme** |
|---|---|---|
| Example | mocha → macchiato; a different accent | gruvbox → nord, everforest |
| The theme file | edit values | a new file in `modules/home/themes/` |
| The five theme packages | usually unchanged | **all five must be renamed in that file** (§2) |
| nvim | keep the plugin, overrides carry the change | **swap the plugin** — see §3 |
| ncspot's `muted` set | re-derive — check whether a formula fits (§1) | re-derive — check whether a formula fits (§1) |
| Realistic effort | one file, one rebuild | one file, plus finding five upstreams |

Since `docs/adr/0032` the packages are **declared in the theme file** rather than
migrated across six others, and `nix flake check` asserts every name resolves —
so a new scheme is one file plus whatever nixpkgs does or does not have. It is
no longer the day-long, ungated job the row above used to describe.

---

## 1. The palette — one file, thirteen consumers

**To switch between schemes that already exist, edit `modules/home/scheme.nix`
— one string — and rebuild.** That is the whole operation; §2 and §3 below are
only for bringing a *new* scheme in.

`modules/home/palette.nix` is a dispatcher over `modules/home/themes/*.nix` and
still evaluates to the same flat attrset it always did, so all thirteen
consumers read it unchanged: **kitty, foot, imv, swaylock, waybar, rofi, mango,
nvim, swaync, fsel, ncspot, Equibop and the lock-screen background ramp**.

Why a file and not a `local.theme` option: `pkgs/default.nix` builds the lock
ramp and is an **overlay**, so it cannot read `config.*`. An option reaches
twelve consumers and misses the thirteenth — the one surface nobody looks at
closely. `docs/adr/0030`.

### Adding a scheme

1. Copy a file in `modules/home/themes/`. Supply **every** key — `rec` makes a
   missing one an eval error, not a default.
2. Declare `contrastFloor` and `ansiFloor` (below).
3. Declare `packages` and `apps` — §2 and §3.
4. Point `scheme.nix` at it and run `nix flake check`.

Contrast is asserted, so an unreadable scheme cannot land quietly the way the
first one did; and every artefact it names must resolve, so a half-packaged one
cannot either.

### Two floors, not one

`contrastFloor` is what **this machine** draws text with — the bar, the menus,
notifications, editor chrome, ncspot's rows. `ansiFloor` is the sixteen terminal
slots, which nothing here draws text in: they are what *other programs* print
with, and they are the scheme's published identity.

They were one number until `docs/adr/0032`. Gruvbox is why they are two — its
normal red is 2.69:1 on its own background, by upstream's design since 2012, and
a single floor would have forced the whole scheme to declare 2.6. `comment`, the
role the check exists for, could then have rotted to the same place unnoticed.

**Declare the number your dimmest role actually measures.** There is no global
minimum under these — there was one, 3.0, and it was removed as an invention: it
arrived with `mocha-high-contrast` out of a request for more readable text and
then read like an external requirement. Nord ships `comment` at 1.69:1, which is
what Nord is. The assertion means only "this theme is as legible as it claims",
which still catches the thing worth catching: an edit that dims a role below the
theme's own declared number.

### Anatomy

It is a `rec` attrset in four colour blocks, plus `packages` and `apps`. `rec`
matters: the semantic roles are defined in terms of the canonical names, so a
**missing key is an eval error**, not a silently-default colour.

| Block | Keys | Who reads it |
|---|---|---|
| Canonical | `bg0`–`bg3`, `fg0`/`fg1`/`fg4`, `mantle`, `mauve`, the 16 ANSI names (`red`…`brWhite`) | the terminals want the full 16; everything else builds from these |
| Semantic roles | `base`, `surface`, `overlay`, `text`, `subtext`, `accent`, `okColor`, `warnColor`, `errColor`, `infoColor` | the bar, the menus, the compositor borders, swaync |
| Terminal aliases | `bg`, `fg`, `selBg` | kitty and foot, which named these first |
| `muted` | `bg`, `fg`, `dim`, `accent`, `ok`, `err`, `surface`, `overlay` | ncspot only |

**Values are bare hex, no leading `#`.** Every consumer spells it differently —
kitty `#rrggbb`, foot bare, GTK CSS `#`, mango `0xrrggbbaa`, fsel and swaync
decimal `rgb(r, g, b)` — so the shared form is the one they all build from.

> **Names outside the ramp earn their place by acquiring a consumer.** `mauve`
> is the accent and `mantle` is Equibop's recessed background; both are
> Catppuccin's own names, so they are lookups rather than inventions. Do not add
> the rest of Mocha's 26 to "complete" the set — a colour nothing reads is one
> the next person assumes is live.

### Two constraints that are not obvious

**The lock ramp follows `bg0`'s hue, and the build asserts it.** The background
pool is a ±6 lightness ramp through `bg0`: all three channels move together, so
every tone keeps `bg0`'s exact channel offsets. `pkgs/default.nix` fails the
build if any tone drifts off that hue, with `tones off … the ramp shifts colour,
not just lightness`. Changing `bg0` needs nothing here — the ramp is derived
from it.

> This check read `R = G = B` until 2026-08-18, because gruvbox's `#282828` is
> neutral and the two are the same thing there. Mocha's `#1e1e2e` is not, so it
> was generalised to what it always meant. If you find yourself wanting to
> delete it rather than generalise it, that is the signal you are about to make
> the lock screen the one surface wearing a colour the palette never named.

**The `muted` set may or may not have a formula.** It is ncspot's deliberately
desaturated variant. Under gruvbox no function reproduced it (`ebdbb2` →
`c9b890` is not a uniform scale) and the eight values were picked by eye; under
Mocha they are each blended 18% toward `bg0`, which works because Mocha is
even. **Check which case you are in** rather than assuming the formula carries
over — if the new scheme's colours vary in saturation the way gruvbox's do, go
back to picking by eye. They live in `palette.nix` rather than next to ncspot
precisely so that this step is visible rather than discovered later.

---

## 2. The five theme packages — declared, not migrated

These are **not hex this repo owns**. Each is an upstream artefact — compiled
SCSS, rendered SVG widget art, cursor bitmaps, or a name another program
resolves internally. `palette.nix` cannot reach any of them, and there is no
version of this repo in which it could.

**They live in the theme file's `packages` block.** Before `docs/adr/0032` they
were spelled out across `theme.nix`, `pkgs/default.nix`, two dotfiles and a
shell script, and a scheme change was a six-file migration with nothing checking
it. Now each is an attribute plus a name, `pkgs/default.nix` resolves them into
`themeGtk`/`themeKvantum`/`themeIcons`/`themeCursor`/`themeYazi`, and
`checks/static.sh` asserts every name resolves to a real directory in the built
closure.

| # | What | Declared as | Note |
|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | **GTK theme** | `packages.gtk` — `attr` + theme directory `name` | GTK4 follows it automatically via `gtk4.theme = config.gtk.theme` |
| 2 | **Icon theme** | `packages.icons`, with an `override.color` where the package is a recolour | Papirus has no `mauve`; `violet` and `orange` are picks from *its* list |
| 3 | **Cursor** | `packages.cursor`, `sub` for a sub-attribute | Rendered bitmaps |
| 4 | **Kvantum (Qt)** | `packages.kvantum` | Linked into `~/.config/Kvantum` by `dotfiles.nix`, and `kvantum.kvconfig` is generated from the same name |
| 5 | **yazi flavor** | `packages.yazi` — `owner`/`repo`/`rev`/`hash`/`file` | ~900 hex of third-party syntax theme, assembled into a `.yazi` package |

Plus the `apps` block, for settings whose value is a scheme's **name**:
`noctalia` (resolved internally against its shipped Assets), `nvim` (§3) and
`zed`.

### Three traps, all still live

> **The names are not guessable from the arguments that build them.**
> `catppuccin-mocha-mauve-standard` (GTK), `catppuccin-mocha-mauve-cursors`
> (cursor) and `catppuccin-mocha-mauve` (Kvantum) are spelled three different
> ways from each other and from the attribute (`mochaMauve`); and
> `capitaine-cursors-themed` installs `Capitaine Cursors (Gruvbox)`, spaces and
> parentheses included. **Read the name off the built package**
> (`ls $out/share/themes`) rather than constructing it.

> **A name only the toolkit can resolve is a name no check can.** `Adwaita-dark`
> renders fine — GTK3 has it compiled in — and no directory for it exists
> anywhere, so nothing can verify it. The stand-in schemes name `adw-gtk3-dark`
> instead, which is a real directory. If a name you want passes visually but the
> check cannot find it, that is the check working.

> **`native = false` means a stand-in**, not a broken entry: an artefact that
> does not follow the scheme, only a neutral that does not fight it. Say why in
> the `why` field. The check prints them on every run, because otherwise the
> only way to notice is to look at the screen and already know.

### Which schemes are actually available

**noctalia is the binding constraint.** It resolves its palette from a name in
its own shipped `Assets/ColorScheme/`, so a scheme it does not ship leaves half
the screen on a different palette in noctalia mode. That fixes the candidate set
at its ten: Ayu, Catppuccin, Dracula, Eldritch, Gruvbox, Kanagawa,
Noctalia-default, Nord, Rose Pine, Tokyo Night.

Of those ten, nixpkgs fully serves **three** — surveyed 2026-08-18:

| | GTK | Kvantum | Icons | Cursor | yazi |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| **Catppuccin** ✅ | `catppuccin-gtk` | `catppuccin-kvantum` | Papirus/violet | `catppuccin-cursors` | upstream |
| **Gruvbox** ✅ | `gruvbox-dark-gtk` | `gruvbox-kvantum` | `gruvbox-plus-icons` | Capitaine | upstream |
| **Nord** ✅ | `nordic` | `nordic` | `nordzy-icon-theme` | Capitaine | `stepbrobd/nord.yazi` |
| Rose Pine | ❌ | ✅ *(nested under `share/Kvantum/themes/`)* | ✅ | ✅ | upstream |
| Kanagawa | ❌ | ❌ | ✅ | ❌ | `yaziPlugins.kanagawa` |
| Dracula | ❌ dropped with gtk-engine-murrine | ❌ `dracula-qt5-theme` is a qt5ct *colour scheme*, not a Kvantum theme | ✅ | ❌ | upstream |
| Ayu | ❌ | ❌ | Papirus/orange | ❌ | upstream |
| Tokyo Night | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | — |
| Eldritch | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | ❌ | — |

Two things that are easy to get wrong here:

- **`nordic` alone supplies GTK, Kvantum *and* cursors**, and spells the GTK and
  Kvantum theme names differently from each other — `Nordic-darker` against
  `Nordic-Darker`. Read both off the package.
- **`yazi-rs/flavors` is not the universal source.** The official collection
  ships only Catppuccin and Dracula. Nord, Gruvbox and the rest live in
  single-scheme repos with `flavor.toml` at the root. Assuming otherwise
  produces a build that fetches fine and copies a path that is not there.

Rose Pine is the nearest miss — legible as published (worst role 3.38:1) and
short only a GTK theme. Adding it means one `native = false`, plus a small
change to the Kvantum search root for its nested layout.

## 3. nvim — swap the plugin

**The plugin is named in the theme file, and the spec is generated.** A scheme
declares `apps.nvim`:

```nix
nvim = {
  spec = "ellisonleao/gruvbox.nvim";   # the lazy.nvim spec
  name = "gruvbox";                    # `:colorscheme` argument, and lazy's `name =`
  lualine = "gruvbox";                 # or "auto"
  setup = ''…lua…'';                   # the plugin's own setup call
  palette = { };                       # see below
};
```

Three files are generated into the nvim tree by `modules/home/dotfiles.nix`:
`lua/plugins/colorscheme.lua` (the spec), `lua/config/scheme.lua` (names only)
and, conditionally, `lua/config/palette.lua`. `lazy.lua` and `ui.lua` stay
hand-written and `require("config.scheme")` — so no file under `dotfiles/nvim/`
names a scheme.

### The decision rule, which is what `palette` encodes

- **The plugin IS the scheme** → `palette = { }`. Take upstream's values. This
  is `gruvbox` and `nord`.
- **The theme DEVIATES from its plugin** → supply the map. `mocha-high-contrast`
  lifts Mocha's greys, so it overrides the plugin's values through
  `color_overrides.mocha`. The map's keys are the *plugin's* vocabulary, the
  values are this file's role names.

**Do not override a foreign plugin's palette.** Overriding 16 keys of a Mocha
theme with nord values leaves 10 Catppuccin ones in place and the result is a
visible hybrid, not nord. The gruvbox → Catppuccin migration confirmed the
mirror image: overriding 20 keys of `gruvbox.nvim` with Mocha values would have
left 34 gruvbox ones behind.

Do not close a key gap by adding the plugin's names to the theme file either.
They are one plugin's internal vocabulary, not this machine's colours — and when
the plugin matches the scheme they are *already correct*.

> **lualine is the sharp edge.** A lualine theme that does not resolve **throws
> at startup** rather than falling back. `"auto"` derives the bar from whatever
> colourscheme actually loaded and cannot fail; name a built-in only when you
> know lualine ships it.

**After a plugin swap, run `:Lazy sync`.** lazy.nvim fetches at runtime, so the
rebuild installs the *config* naming a plugin that is not on disk yet.

---

## 4. Gate it

```sh
nix flake check
```

**What it catches:** eval errors from a missing palette key; a generated file
that is missing or empty; a generated file that no longer contains the accent in
its consumer's own spelling; a mango mode config that stopped `source=`ing its
colours; any palette hex reappearing in a hand-written file under `dotfiles/`;
and a tinted lock ramp.

**Contrast IS caught**, per theme and against **two** declared floors:
`contrastFloor` for what this machine draws text with, `ansiFloor` for the
sixteen terminal slots. Every role is recomputed against what it actually sits
on — including `muted.err`, which is audited as the *background* it is, with
`muted.fg` on top, because that is the pair ncspot renders. The check reads the
palette **resolved by Nix**, so a role written as an alias is audited like any
other; it used to read the file with `sed` and four aliased roles went unaudited
for a release. `docs/adr/0032`.

**The theme packages ARE caught now too**, which §2 above used to say they were
not: every name a theme declares must resolve to a real directory in the built
closure, toolkit built-ins included.

**What it still does not catch:**

- **Zed.** Both the extension id and the theme name live in Zed's own registry.
  Nothing here can assert Zed resolves either — open it and look.
- **Whether an artefact suits the scheme.** The check asserts `Bibata-Modern-Amber`
  exists, not that it suits the scheme.
- **Colours the palette does not name.** They escape to upstream and are
  invisible here; that is how nvim's comment colour sat outside the palette
  through a whole migration. **Which colour a program actually uses is a
  measurement** — ask it with `nvim_get_hl` or the equivalent, do not read it
  off the theme.

---

## 5. Apply

```sh
rebuild        # sudo nixos-rebuild switch --flake "$HOME/src/nix-config#thinkpad"
```

Quote the flake ref — `EXTENDED_GLOB` makes `#` a pattern operator in zsh.

Then reload, per `CLAUDE.md`'s table. **Rebuild first, always**: everything
under `dotfiles/mango/` is a store path, so reloading alone re-reads the *last*
rebuild's copy, which is indistinguishable from the change having had no effect.

| Surface | Reload |
|---|---|
| mango, waybar | `~/.config/mango/scripts/reload.sh`, `mango-reload`, `waybar-reload` |
| GTK apps | `~/.config/mango/scripts/system/gtk-apply.sh` |
| kitty | `kill -SIGUSR1 $KITTY_PID` |
| foot, ncspot, imv, yazi, zed, htop | restart the app |
| nvim | restart |
| swaync | mode switch (`autostart.conf` owns its lifecycle — `docs/adr/0005`) |
| Equibop | **mode switch** — `lib.sh` writes `enabledThemes`, so a rebuild alone leaves the old theme enabled |

---

## 6. Verify by output

Exit status proves nothing here — a missing theme and a broken theme look
identical, and both look like a theme someone chose. Every command below was run
against this repo and produces output you can read.

```sh
# The generated files, as the rebuild will install them.
G=$(nix eval --raw '.#nixosConfigurations.thinkpad.config.home-manager.users.henry.home.activationPackage')
grep -r 'color=' "$G/home-files/.config/mango/universal/colors-tiling.conf"
cat "$G/home-files/.config/nvim/lua/plugins/colorscheme.lua"
cat "$G/home-files/.config/nvim/lua/config/scheme.lua"
cat "$G/home-files/.config/fsel/config.toml"
sed -n '1,16p' "$G/home-files/.config/swaync/style.css"
```

```sh
# GTK / icons / cursor — what the session actually resolved.
for k in gtk-theme icon-theme cursor-theme; do
  printf '%-14s ' "$k"; dconf read /org/gnome/desktop/interface/$k
done
grep -E 'theme-name|cursor' ~/.config/gtk-3.0/settings.ini
```

> **Use `dconf read`, not `gsettings get`.** From a task shell or this repo's
> devShell, `gsettings` reports `No schemas installed` — which reads exactly
> like "the theme is unset" and is not.

```sh
# Qt / Kvantum
head -3 ~/.config/Kvantum/kvantum.kvconfig      # expect theme=<your theme>

# nvim actually loading the generated palette. ONLY schemes that deviate from
# their own plugin generate one — three of the five do not, and its absence is
# correct for those (§3).
nvim --headless '+lua local p=require("config.palette") print("keys="..vim.tbl_count(p).." base="..p.base)' +qa

# …and that the plugin actually applied them, which the above does not show.
# The colourscheme name comes from the theme file — read it out of scheme.lua
# rather than typing one, or you are testing a scheme you are not running.
nvim --headless '+lua vim.cmd("colorscheme " .. require("config.scheme").name)
  local h = vim.api.nvim_get_hl(0, { name = "Keyword", link = false })
  print(vim.g.colors_name .. " Keyword.fg=" .. string.format("#%06x", h.fg))' +qa
```

```sh
# The whole assertion suite, with the palette section visible
SYS=$(nix eval --raw '.#nixosConfigurations.thinkpad.config.system.build.toplevel')
bash checks/static.sh "$PWD" "$G" "$SYS" | sed -n '/Generated palette/,/^$/p'
```

Expect 18 ticks in that last block. A count that has *dropped* is the failure
mode this repo is built around: a scan that stops matching passes by finding
nothing.

One of the 18 exists only to guard that: `read N palette values to scan for`
reports how many hex values the stray-hex scan pulled **out of `palette.nix`**,
and fails below 16. The needles are read from the palette rather than listed in
the check, so changing the scheme does not silently leave the scanner hunting
for the old one — which is the same bug in the check that the check exists to
find.

---

## 7. Traps specific to this operation

- **nvim is broken between the edit and the rebuild.** `colorscheme.lua` does
  `require("config.palette")`, and that file only exists in the generated tree.
  Open nvim after editing but before rebuilding and lazy.nvim reports a failed
  plugin config and you get no colourscheme. Not damage — rebuild and it is
  gone — but it looks alarming and it is expected.
- **mango's `config.conf` keeps a stale copy until the next mode switch.** It is
  written at runtime by `scripts/lib.sh` from the mode config, is deliberately
  untracked (`docs/adr/0002`), and is skipped by the stray-hex check for that
  reason. Switch modes once after a palette change.
- **Store files are read-only, so you cannot hand-patch one to preview a
  colour.** Edit `palette.nix` and rebuild; there is no faster loop, and trying
  to make one is how `~/.config` acquires a second owner.
- **A GTK `url()` that fails to resolve draws the missing-image box and logs
  nothing.** If a new GTK theme references assets by relative path, they must
  end up beside the stylesheet in the store — see `docs/adr/0009` for the
  wlogout instance of this.
- **Do not run `dbus-update-activation-environment` or `systemctl --user
  import-environment` to make a theme change take effect.** From this repo's
  devShell it writes a scratchpad `XDG_CONFIG_HOME` into every user unit started
  afterwards. `docs/gotchas.md` → Session environment.

---

## 8. Rollback

Colours are cosmetic, so the boot-level safety nets are not needed here — this
is a `git` problem, not a generation problem.

```sh
git diff --stat                      # confirm the blast radius first
git restore modules/home/palette.nix # or the whole change
rebuild
```

If a rebuild has already landed and you want the previous generation back,
`nixos-rebuild switch --rollback` works, but reverting the commit and rebuilding
is cleaner and leaves the repo and the running system agreeing about why.

---

## 9. The short version

**Switching to a scheme that already exists:**

1. Edit `modules/home/scheme.nix` — one string.
2. `nix flake check`.
3. `rebuild`, then reload — rebuild first, always. Equibop and swaync need a
   **mode switch**, not just a rebuild.

**Adding a new one:**

1. Copy a file in `modules/home/themes/`. Supply every key — `rec` makes a
   missing one an eval error.
2. Declare `contrastFloor` and `ansiFloor` (§1), the five `packages` (§2) and
   the three `apps` (§2, §3).
3. Point `scheme.nix` at it, `nix flake check`, `rebuild`, reload.
4. Read the output of §6, and the `Theme packages` block — stand-ins are listed
   there on every run.
