# Architecture decision records

Numbered records of decisions that were **expensive to learn** and would be
expensive to re-litigate. Started 2026-07-30, after the Arch→NixOS migration,
by extracting decisions that already existed as prose.

`CLAUDE.md` remains the standing description of *how the system is now*. These
records explain *why it is that way*, and — more usefully — what happened when
it was the other way. Where the reasoning already lives in `CLAUDE.md` or
these link to the record rather than duplicating it, per
`docs/agents/domain.md`.

| [0024](0024-the-unattended-lock-follows-the-mode.md) | The unattended lock follows the mode; swaylock is its fallback *and* its proof | Accepted (amends [0023](0023-noctalia-owns-its-own-actions.md); extends [0018](0018-lock-background-is-a-pool.md)) |
| [0025](0025-patch-noctalias-mango-backend.md) | Patch noctalia's mango backend where it speaks dwl's dead flags, rather than route around it | Accepted (follows the correction on [0020](0020-noctalia-is-a-desktop-mode.md)) |
| [0026](0026-serve-the-ppd-bus-name-from-tlp.md) | Serve the power-profiles-daemon bus name from TLP, rather than leave it unowned | Accepted (follows [0017](0017-tlp-profiles-not-platform-profile.md), [0005](0005-one-owner-per-daemon.md); closes an inert widget from [0020](0020-noctalia-is-a-desktop-mode.md)) |
| [0027](0027-one-editor-nvim.md) | One editor: nvim. Helix is removed | Accepted (amends [0009](0009-generated-config-over-linked-files.md), [0007](0007-language-servers-declared.md)) |

| [0030](0030-the-scheme-is-a-file-not-an-option.md) | The scheme is a file, not an option; and contrast is asserted | Accepted (follows [0028](0028-one-palette-reaches-every-config-it-can.md), [0029](0029-the-lock-ramp-asserts-hue-not-greyness.md)) |

| [0037](0037-night-light-does-not-cross-a-mode-switch.md) | Night light does not cross a mode switch; noctalia mode ends it | Accepted (extends [0005](0005-one-owner-per-daemon.md); follows the handover in [0031](0031-the-idle-inhibitor-outlives-the-bar.md)) |

| [0040](0040-config-conf-is-a-link-not-a-copy.md) | `config.conf` is a link, not a copy | Accepted (extends the link ownership of [0034](0034-colour-follows-the-mode-artefacts-do-not.md); keeps the `recursive` tree of [0002](0002-out-of-store-dotfiles.md)) |

| [0044](0044-one-request-carries-the-tooltip.md) | One request carries the tooltip, and the way past it is a link | Accepted, **amended 2026-08-24 — the control-centre row is two keys, not a picker** (extends [0038](0038-weather-is-a-bar-module-the-menu-reads.md)) |
| [0045](0045-each-mode-owns-its-wallpaper.md) | Each mode owns its wallpaper | Accepted (supersedes the wallpaper clause of [0020](0020-noctalia-is-a-desktop-mode.md); its shell clause was reversed by [0051](0051-waybar-is-the-tiling-bar-again.md) and trimmed out) |
| [0047](0047-a-retired-daemon-is-a-call-that-exits-0.md) | A retired daemon is a call that exits 0 | Accepted (finishes [0045](0045-each-mode-owns-its-wallpaper.md); ends the swayosd trade in [0020](0020-noctalia-is-a-desktop-mode.md)) |
| [0048](0048-state-colour-rides-the-class-the-script-prints.md) | State colour rides the class the script prints | Accepted (amends the "one colour" clause of [0045](0045-each-mode-owns-its-wallpaper.md); sources it from [0028](0028-one-palette-reaches-every-config-it-can.md)) |
| [0049](0049-a-shell-is-four-surfaces-not-one.md) | A shell is four surfaces, and the bar was the only declared one | Accepted (extends [0045](0045-each-mode-owns-its-wallpaper.md); applies [0048](0048-state-colour-rides-the-class-the-script-prints.md)'s resting-state rule to the popup; depends on [0047](0047-a-retired-daemon-is-a-call-that-exits-0.md) for the OSD being the only one) |
| [0050](0050-the-weather-panel-is-rofis.md) | The weather panel is rofi's, because a dropdown answers no key | Accepted (reverses the click clause of 0046; keeps [0038](0038-weather-is-a-bar-module-the-menu-reads.md), [0044](0044-one-request-carries-the-tooltip.md); shares [0047](0047-a-retired-daemon-is-a-call-that-exits-0.md)'s finding that no dropdown opens from outside the bar) |
| [0051](0051-waybar-is-the-tiling-bar-again.md) | Waybar is the tiling bar again, and wayle is installed but unstarted | Accepted (reverses [0045](0045-each-mode-owns-its-wallpaper.md) for tiling and the swaync/swayosd clauses of [0047](0047-a-retired-daemon-is-a-call-that-exits-0.md); follows [0050](0050-the-weather-panel-is-rofis.md); leaves [0020](0020-noctalia-is-a-desktop-mode.md) alone) |

| [0053](0053-the-bar-separates-selection-from-alarm-by-shape.md) | The bar separates selection from alarm by shape, not by hue | Accepted (amends the colour half of [0042](0042-separators-belong-to-the-layout.md) and [0051](0051-waybar-is-the-tiling-bar-again.md); applies [0032](0032-the-theme-file-owns-its-artefacts.md)'s measured-not-chosen rule to the stylesheet) |
| [0054](0054-a-module-reports-the-screen-not-its-schedule.md) | A module reports the screen, not its own schedule | Accepted (applies [0048](0048-state-colour-rides-the-class-the-script-prints.md)'s resting-state rule; closes a hole in [0051](0051-waybar-is-the-tiling-bar-again.md)'s one-glyph-pack check) |
| [0055](0055-night-light-has-a-manual-hold-not-only-a-schedule.md) | Night light has a manual hold, not only a schedule | Accepted (corrects [0054](0054-a-module-reports-the-screen-not-its-schedule.md), which made the module honest about a schedule nobody had chosen to be limited to) |
| [0056](0056-a-declared-refresh-signal-needs-a-sender.md) | A declared refresh signal needs a sender | Accepted (generalises the bar-push half of [0054](0054-a-module-reports-the-screen-not-its-schedule.md); repairs four modules left behind by [0051](0051-waybar-is-the-tiling-bar-again.md)) |
| [0057](0057-one-glyph-pack-was-never-enforced.md) | One glyph pack was never enforced | Accepted (the check [0051](0051-waybar-is-the-tiling-bar-again.md) and [0054](0054-a-module-reports-the-screen-not-its-schedule.md) relied on matched 12 of 51 escapes and passed; adds the third neutral tier [0053](0053-the-bar-separates-selection-from-alarm-by-shape.md) had in practice but not in writing) |
| [0058](0058-one-text-face-and-the-window-that-is-playing.md) | One text face, one calendar surface, and the window that is playing | Accepted (follows [0057](0057-one-glyph-pack-was-never-enforced.md); retires 0019, 0021, 0035, 0046 and trims [0045](0045-each-mode-owns-its-wallpaper.md)) |
| [0059](0059-the-bar-is-3270-body-text-is-hack.md) | The bar is 3270; body text is Hack | Accepted (reverses the font clause of [0058](0058-one-text-face-and-the-window-that-is-playing.md); its glyph unification stands) |

## Format

Each record: **Status**, **Context** (what was true, and what went wrong),
**Decision**, **Consequences** (including what it costs). Write the failure
mode down — a decision whose motivating bug is not recorded gets undone by the
next person who thinks it looks redundant.
