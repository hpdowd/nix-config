# Built on system/weather.sh's panel, which answered the same problem for the

# nothing else on the machine uses. docs/adr/0058, docs/adr/0050.

# The grid is built here rather than taken from cal(1). `cal -w` prints week
# numbers and marks nothing, and finding today inside its fixed-width output
# means counting columns — so the day that is today would be located by
# arithmetic on a string rather than known. Built here, the cell knows.
