# The control centre — one menu that shows the state of every toggle, instead of
# ten keys you have to remember and a bar you have to squint at.
#
# Why this exists. noctalia's control centre was one of the shell.sh actions
# with `fb=none`, i.e. a key that reported "Only in noctalia mode" everywhere
# else. The gap was never the toggles — every one of them already had a
# key and a script here — it was that nothing showed you the set, or the state
# each one was in. That is most of what "cohesive" means when noctalia is
# described that way: not a nicer widget, one place where the state is legible.
#
# What is not reproducible, and is not attempted. noctalia is one process
# holding one state model, so its bar glyph, its OSD and its control-centre
# slider cannot disagree. Here every fact has a different owner, and this file
# is a reader of those owners, never a second one:
#
#   - five rows take their icon and their state from the waybar module that
#     owns the fact (`night-mode.sh status`, `idle-inhibit.sh status`,
#     `power-profile.sh`, `phone-status.sh status`, `weather.sh read`), parsed
#     out of the JSON those modules already emit. Reproducing the glyph here
#     would be a second owner for it, and the two would drift the first time
#     one changed — docs/adr/0028's failure, one directory over. The ladders
#     behind those glyphs are why it matters: ten battery levels for the phone,
#     thirteen weather glyphs by WMO code and time of day.
#   - the rest read the same command their own menu reads, and nothing here
#     writes state: every action delegates to the script that already owned it.
#
# So a row can only ever be stale, never wrong — it is rebuilt from scratch on
# every open and after every action, which is why the menu re-renders in a loop
# rather than closing. That loop is the feature.
#
# `?` is a state. An unreadable owner renders as `?`, never as "off": "the thing
# is off" and "I could not ask" are the two this repo keeps confusing, and a row
# that quietly reads "off" for a broken module is this codebase's signature bug
# with a nicer font. Every state_* below has that branch, deliberately.
#
# Reached as `shell.sh control-center`, so in noctalia mode the key goes to
# noctalia's own panel over IPC and this file is not run at all. docs/adr/0033.

# `Control+Return` as `kb-accept-custom` ("return what I typed, not what is

# the key lets go. `rofi -list-keybindings` prints the table to check against.
#
# Unsetting costs nothing here and only here: the call passes `-no-custom`, so
# accept-custom had nothing to accept. Today it falls into dmenu.c's
# `only_selected` else-branch, which restarts the view without acting — a key
# that already did nothing and never said so.
#
# On the command line, not in config.rasi: both mean something on this menu
# alone, exactly as `-no-custom` does — and `kb-accept-custom` must keep its

# ── State ─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────
#
# Each state_<id> prints "<icon><tab><state>". Two fields because of the three
# rows that take their icon from the module that owns the fact; the renderer
# does not care which kind a row is.

# Pull several fields out of a waybar module's own JSON, in one jq. The three
# module-backed rows want two or three fields each, and a jq per field is three
# processes for one answer — on a menu that re-renders after every action.
#
# Empty rather than `null` on a missing key, and empty on non-JSON (jq exits 5
# and prints nothing), so the callers' `[ -n … ]` guards see the same thing
# however the module failed. That is deliberate: "the module said off" and "the
# module said nothing" must not arrive here looking different, because only the
# second one is allowed to render as anything but a state.
#
# Joined on U+001F, not a tab, and @tsv is gone with it. `IFS=$'\t' read` cannot
# see an empty leading field: tab is IFS *whitespace*, so bash strips it and
# collapses runs of it, and `\toffline` arrives as one field. Every reader here
# then takes the class as its icon and renders `?` for a module that answered
# perfectly — which is exactly the failure this file was written to make
# impossible, hiding inside the helper that was supposed to prevent it. It sat
# here unnoticed because night, awake and power always emit a glyph;
# custom/phone emits an empty text as its resting state, and it bit on the
# first render. U+001F is not whitespace, so empty fields survive.
#
# `gsub` replaces what @tsv used to escape: a tooltip may carry a real newline
# (custom/phone's does), and `read` would stop dead at it.
