# WHY A SCRIPT AND NOT A PER-MODE bind= OVERRIDE. mango's binds append and the
# dispatcher stops at the FIRST match (src/mango.c: "only match the first
# keybind"), so a mode conf sourced ahead of universal/bind.conf really would
# override it — but mango also prints a `[WARNING] Key binding conflict` naming
# both files and lines for every duplicate, and thirteen of those on every start
# is how a real conflict warning stops being read. One bind, one script.
#
# THE FAILURE THIS GUARDS. `noctalia-shell ipc call <target> <fn>` prints
# "Target not found." or "Function not found." and EXITS 0 — the same shape as
# the dwl-era `mmsg -s -d` that broke five scripts silently. A successful void
# call prints nothing, so OUTPUT is the signal and the exit status is worthless.
# checks/static.sh asserts every pair below against the shipped shell; this is
# the runtime backstop for the case the check cannot see.
