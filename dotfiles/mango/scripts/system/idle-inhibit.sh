# Usage: idle-inhibit.sh <toggle|on|off|status|is-on>
#
# "Do not sleep" — the escape hatch for a long unattended build. It holds a
# `zwp_idle_inhibit_manager_v1` inhibitor, which is the only thing swayidle's
# ladder honours here: swayidle takes its idle signal from the compositor, and
# `systemd-inhibit --what=idle` never reaches it (docs/SYSTEM.md §9).
#
# Why a unit and not waybar's built-in idle_inhibitor module. That module holds
# the inhibitor on the bar's own layer surface, as a static bool in the waybar
# process, toggled only by a click on the widget. waybar exposes no IPC and no
# signal for it — SIGUSR1/2 drive bar visibility, and `signal` refreshes
# `custom/*` modules only — so there was no way to reach it from a key. Worse,
# the state died with the bar: `waybar-reload`, a mode switch, a layout switch
# and SUPER+/ all handed the machine back to the idle ladder, glyph included,
# with nothing logged. A unit outlives every one of those. docs/adr/0031.
#
# The inhibitor is wlinhibit, whose whole job is to hold one open until killed;
# the unit is declared in modules/home/default.nix. Process lifetime is the
# state, so there is no state file to drift out of step with it — and so this
# is the one mango script with no reason to source lib.sh.

# Escapes, not literal glyphs, for the reason power-profile.sh gives: written
# literally on 2026-07-31 its icons were lost in transit and every branch
# assigned the empty string, so the module emitted {"text":""} and waybar drew
# nothing. Both are past U+ffff, so `\U` with eight digits — bash's `\u` takes
# four, and `3` silently means U+F04B followed by "3".
