# Rewritten 2026-08-12. This wrote /sys/firmware/acpi/platform_profile, which
# moved a thinkpad_acpi dytc hint and nothing else: governor, epp, min freq,
# max freq and boost were byte-identical across all three settings, so the
# toggle changed the bar and not the machine. TLP owns those, and TLP 1.9
# carries a third profile (sav, `tlp power-saver`) beyond its AC/BAT split.
# docs/adr/0017.
#
# `power-mode` is the root wrapper from modules/system/power.nix -- it runs tlp
# and pins the iGPU, which tlp cannot do for sav on its own. wheel may run it
# Nopasswd; nothing else here needs root.
#
# Pass a profile to set it directly. `fanless` is the name the bar and the docs
# use; `power-saver` is TLP's own verb and both are accepted, because the error
# for a wrong one is a notification rather than anything visible in the bar:
#
#   power-profile-cycle.sh fanless
#   power-profile-cycle.sh toggle-fanless   <- waybar right-click
