# wlsunset has no runtime IPC — the only way to change temperature is to
# restart it with new arguments. So the *service* owns the process (geo
# scheduling, lifecycle, survives login) and this wrapper reads the chosen
# strength from a state file at start. night-mode.sh writes that file and
# restarts the unit, which is what makes the waybar temperature picker work
# without the script ever owning wlsunset itself.
#
# Location and day temperature come from the unit's Environment=, so they stay
# declared in Nix; only the user-tunable night temperature lives in state.
