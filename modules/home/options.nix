      Absolute path to this repo's checkout on the live filesystem.

      This CANNOT be derived, which is worth understanding before trying to
      remove it. A flake always evaluates from a *copy of itself* in
      /nix/store, so `./.` and `self` both yield a store path. That is exactly
      right for `source = ../../dotfiles/kitty`, and useless for an out-of-store
      symlink, which by definition must point at a mutable path outside the
      store. `builtins.getEnv "PWD"` is not an escape hatch either: it returns
      "" under pure evaluation. Nix genuinely cannot discover where you cloned
      the repo, so somebody has to tell it — once.

      Declared here so that is the only place it is written down.
      `dotfiles.nix` uses it for the remaining `link` entries and `shell.nix`
      for the rebuild aliases. Clone the repo elsewhere and this default is the
      single line to change.

      This option becomes dead the moment the last out-of-store entry is
      converted to a store path, because at that point nothing in the flake
      cares where the checkout lives.
