#
# This is the scheme this machine wore until 2026-08-18, recovered from commit
# c0407a9 rather than retyped. Three things had to be added to it, because the
# interface grew after it was retired: `mantle` (Equibop's recessed background),
# the two floors, and the `packages`/`apps` blocks. Two values in the muted set
# also changed — see there; they predate the contrast check and would not pass
# it.
#
# GRUVBOX IS THE REASON THE ANSI FLOOR IS SEPARATE. Its normal red is 2.69:1 on
# `bg0` — dimmer than any other colour on this machine, and that is upstream's
# deliberate design, not a mistake to correct. Under one combined floor the
# whole theme would have had to declare 2.6, which would have let `comment`
# quietly rot to the same place. docs/adr/0032.

  # upstreams parameterise the folder hue and nothing else, and app icons are
  # brand colours that must not follow a scheme.
  #
  # The yazi flavour left this block entirely — it is 220 lines of colour, so
  # it is written from the palette in `pkgs/yazi-flavor.nix` and needs no name.
  #
  # NOT what this scheme used before 2026-08-18, which is worth knowing if you
  # are comparing against git history: Kvantum was a lone hand-carried
  # `.kvconfig`, the yazi flavour was 916 vendored lines under `dotfiles/`, and
  # the icons were Papirus recoloured yellow rather than a Gruvbox icon set.
  # Nothing here is vendored.
