# Heartbox — upstream's values, plus the four things it does not publish.
#
# From `noctalia-dev/noctalia-colorschemes`, not from noctalia-shell: the
# package ships ten schemes and Heartbox is not one of them, so
# `modules/home/dotfiles.nix` writes its JSON into
# `~/.config/noctalia/colorschemes/` from the values below. docs/adr/0041.
#
# THE FIRST SCHEME THIS REPO COULD NOT HAVE WORN. nixpkgs has no Heartbox GTK
# theme, Kvantum theme or cursor set, and there is no Heartbox nvim plugin,
# Zed theme or yazi flavour anywhere. Under the arrangement `docs/adr/0032`
# described, that made it unadoptable — five of the six artefacts would have
# been stand-ins. All six are generated from the values below now, which is
# what `docs/adr/0041` was written to make possible.
#
# Upstream publishes a full sixteen-slot terminal palette, which the registry
# entry drops and the source file does not — so the ANSI set here is looked up
# rather than invented. Derived here and marked as such: `mantle`, the `muted`
# set, and `bg3`.
rec {
  # --- Legibility, asserted by checks/static.sh -----------------------------
  # MEASURED, not chosen. `brBlack` is upstream's own #4a3a3e and it is 1.72:1,
  # which is what this scheme is — the same situation `nord.nix` records at
  # 1.69. The floor states the number rather than legislating against it.

  # reads as an error state across half the screen.

  # Each is blended toward `bg0` until it clears 4:1 on the raised `surface`

    # audited as the pair that is actually rendered. 4.52:1.
