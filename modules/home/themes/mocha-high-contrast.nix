# Catppuccin Mocha, grey ramp lifted to WCAG AAA.
#
# Selected by `modules/home/scheme.nix`. Mocha's hues, on Mocha's own `crust`
# as the background, with every text-bearing colour at 7:1 or better against
# what it sits on.
#
# WHY THIS EXISTS. Mocha's accents were never the problem — all twelve clear
# AAA on `base` unaided. Its *greys* are. Measured against the running editor
# rather than guessed at: nvim paints Comment with `overlay2` (5.81:1 on Mocha's
# base) and `brBlack`/`overlay1` carries timestamps and inactive labels at
# 4.44:1. Those are the least saturated, most-read colours on the machine, so
# "the text is hard to read" is a precise complaint about them rather than a
# vague one about the scheme.
#
# One thing this theme does NOT fix: nvim's LineNr takes `surface1`, a
# *background* tone used as foreground, and lands near 2:1 here as it does
# upstream. That is Catppuccin's deliberate subtlety, not a palette bug — the
# ramp below is chosen so it is no worse than Mocha's, and making it legible is
# a highlight override rather than a colour.
#
# WHAT CHANGED from `mocha.nix`, and nothing else did:
#   - `bg0` drops from Mocha's `base` to its `crust` (#1e1e2e → #11111b), which
#     buys ~1.14x on everything at once. The old `base` becomes `bg1`, so the
#     background ramp is Mocha's own, shifted one step down.
#   - the greys are lifted until they clear 7:1, by raising HSV value and easing
#     saturation: `brBlack` #7f849c → #999eb7, ncspot's `dim` likewise.
#   - the twelve accents are **byte-identical to Mocha's**. They already passed;
#     changing them would have made this a different scheme rather than a more
#     legible one, and the theme packages below are shared with `mocha`
#     precisely because the hues are.
#
# The numbers are asserted, not asserted-once-and-trusted: `checks/static.sh`
# recomputes every ratio in this file on each `nix flake check`, so a future
# edit that dims a grey fails the build rather than the eye.
