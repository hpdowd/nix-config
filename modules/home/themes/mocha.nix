# NOT the most legible scheme this machine has: its grey ramp is the weak part,
# and `brBlack` sits at 4.44:1 against `bg0` where 7:1 is the floor the sibling
# theme holds to. Kept faithful anyway — this is what Catppuccin Mocha IS, and a
# "fixed" Mocha that is no longer Mocha is the kind of drift this whole
# arrangement exists to prevent. Pick `mocha-high-contrast` if you want the
# ramp lifted.

  # --- Legibility, asserted by checks/static.sh -----------------------------
  # TWO floors, because two different promises are being made and collapsing
  # them into one number forces a lie in whichever direction it is set.
  #
  # `contrastFloor` covers what THIS MACHINE'S UI draws text with — the bar, the
  # menus, notifications, editor chrome, ncspot's rows. Declared per theme
  # rather than fixed globally because upstream Mocha genuinely does not reach
  # WCAG AA on its greys (`brBlack` is 4.44:1), and a global 4.5 floor would
  # make it impossible to ship Catppuccin Mocha *as Catppuccin Mocha*. Stating
  # the weak number is more honest than quietly raising it, and the assertion
  # still catches any future edit that dims it further.
  contrastFloor = 4.4;

  # `ansiFloor` covers the sixteen terminal slots, which are a different kind of
  # thing: nothing on this machine draws its own text in them — they are what
  # OTHER programs print with, and they are the scheme's published identity. On
  # Mocha the two sets coincide, so this floor costs nothing here; it exists
  # because on Gruvbox they do not, and gruvbox's normal red is 2.69:1 by
  # upstream's design. Separating them keeps the number that matters high
  # instead of dragging it down to the weakest ANSI slot. docs/adr/0032.

  # the darkest of it. Discord's theme needs a recessed tone for pressed
  # controls, and inventing one would put a colour on screen that Mocha does
  # not contain. Mocha's own name for it, so it is a lookup and not a choice.

  # `bright` equal to `normal` for the six chromatic slots. Reproduced here

  # loud enough to read as an error state.
  #
  # Under gruvbox these were picked by eye and no formula reproduced them. Mocha
  # is uniform enough that one does: each is blended 18% toward `bg0`, which is
  # what "dimmed but still itself" means on a pastel scheme. Stated so the next
  # scheme change knows whether it can repeat the trick — it can only if the new
  # scheme is likewise even, and should go back to picking by eye if it is not.
  #
  # They live in this file anyway, because the point of it is that **every
  # colour on this machine has one home**. A muted variant kept next to its one
  # consumer is exactly how the palette came to exist in three places before
  # 2026-08-14: it looks local right up until someone changes the scheme and

    # `surface` below, under this theme's own declared floor, and the contrast
    # check caught it on its first run. Not a fidelity question — the muted set
    # is this repo's derivation, not Catppuccin's, so lifting it costs nothing.

    # it is actually rendered. It passed because the check measured it against
    # `surface`, a pair ncspot never draws. Audited as what it is now: `fg` on
    # `err` is 4.65:1. docs/adr/0032.

  # falls back to Adwaita and looks merely unstyled.
