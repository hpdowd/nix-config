# Selected by `modules/home/scheme.nix`. See modules/home/palette.nix for how
# these files are chosen and what the shared key names mean.
#
# The sixteen `nordN` colours are Nord's published palette. Where a role has to
# pick among them, the pick follows noctalia's own shipped
# `Assets/ColorScheme/Nord/Nord.json`, because noctalia resolves its half of the
# machine from that file by name — taking the same values is what keeps the
# shell and the bar agreeing.
#
# NORD IS THE DIMMEST SCHEME HERE, and this file ships it that way. `nord3`
# (#4c566a) is Nord's comment colour and it is **1.69:1** on `nord0` — the
# lowest number in this directory by a wide margin, and the scheme's
# best-known complaint. It is not a mistake to correct: it is what Nord is, and
# a "fixed" Nord whose greys have been lifted is a different scheme wearing the
# name. The floor below states the number rather than legislating against it.
#
# If it turns out to be too dim in use, the fix is a `nord-high-contrast`
# sibling that lifts the grey ramp along Nord's own `nord0`→`nord4` line and
# leaves the hues alone — `mocha-high-contrast.nix` is the worked example, and
# it exists because exactly this complaint was made about Mocha. Do that as a
# second file; do not edit this one.
