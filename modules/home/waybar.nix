# names; `lib.genAttrs` emits definitions for exactly the names a layout uses.
# An unused definition cannot linger, and A name with no definition is an eval
# error instead of a module that renders as nothing. That is why these are
# generated: the four hand-maintained .jsonc files drifted, and `custom/window`
# ended up with max-length 60 in two and 80 in a third. docs/adr/0009.
#
# `style-*.css` stay hand-written (rules, not settings) while `colors.css` is
# generated (data that also lived in two other files): docs/SYSTEM.md §6 for
# the line between them, docs/adr/0028 for why a drifted palette gets a check
# rather than a convention.

  # Font Awesome, 16 Material, one Octicon, one Linux and three bare Unicode
  # arrows before 2026-08-27 — four vocabularies at four different stroke
  # weights, which is most of what made it read as assembled rather than
  # designed.
  #
  # These are the glyphs a module's label carries, and a label is text. The
  # window title, the minimized count and the battery wear real Papirus art
  # instead, through `-gtk-icontheme()` in the stylesheet — see `appIcons` and
  # `batteryRungs` above, and docs/adr/0052. nf-md is what the rest still use:
  # Material is the design language Papirus's symbolic set follows, which is why
  # the two sit together.
  #
  # Every codepoint was checked by rendering it, not by trusting its name — two
  # were the other way round from what they are called (`md-memory` U+F035B is
  # the CPU chip, `md-chip` U+F061A is the RAM stick). checks/static.sh asserts
  # the pack holds.
