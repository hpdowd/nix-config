  # instead of dying. With panic_on_oops it panics at the first fault and
  # reboots, which matters for more than convenience: cutting power mid-freeze
  # leaves the i8042 latched, and the next boot enumerates the keyboard without
  # enabling it ("Failed to enable keyboard on isa0060/serio0") — so the greeter
  # takes no keystrokes and needs a *second* hard reset. Rebooting cleanly is
  # what breaks that chain. The panic still reaches /sys/fs/pstore.
