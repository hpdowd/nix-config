  # SVGs in which every colour is one of three sentinel hexes, so the recolour
  # is a string replace and any palette can wear it. Upstream reaches that
  # through `whiskers` and three Tera templates — a layer whose whole job is
  # resolving Catppuccin FLAVOUR NAMES, which this repo does not have.
  #
  # The build half is upstream's own `scripts/`, run unpatched: hotspots, the
  # eleven scales, xcursorgen and the 113 aliases. The hotspot is a hidden

  # regex over its `d=` gets it wrong wherever there is one, and the symptom is
  # a click point a pixel off that nobody reports.
  #
  # THE SENTINEL COUNTS ARE ASSERTED, before and after. A `sed` that stops
  # matching leaves a complete, valid, UNRECOLOURED set: the build succeeds,
  # the theme resolves, the artefact check finds its directory, and the pointer
  # is still Catppuccin mauve. Exact numbers rather than a floor because the

  # paletteKvantum — the Qt widget theme, recoloured from the palette
  # ==========================================================================
  # docs/adr/0041, phase 2. A Kvantum theme is two files: a `.kvconfig` whose
  # `[GeneralColors]` block is plain INI, and a `.svg` holding the widget art.
  # The INI half was always generatable; the art was the open question, and it
  # was answered by measuring all 37 themes Kvantum ships:
  #
  #   KvantumAlt   21 distinct colours, 25 KB — 18 of them EXACT greys and the
  #                other three off by one channel step
  #   the rest     39 to 97 colours, 75 to 182 KB, all of them scheme art
  #
  # So the base is chosen for being achromatic, not for being pretty: a
  # greyscale source has a lightness ramp and nothing else, and a lightness
  # ramp can be mapped onto THIS palette's own `mantle`→`fg0` axis without
  # inventing a single relationship. `gruvbox-kvantum`, which this replaces,
  # is 31 colours of somebody else's gruvbox and could only ever be gruvbox.
  #
  # Not pinned by rev — the source is nixpkgs' own Kvantum, which moves with
  # `nix flake update`. So the assertions are a FLOOR on how many colours were
  # recoloured plus an exact subset test on the result, rather than phase 1's
  # exact count: a bump that retouches the art must not break the build, and a
  # substitution that stops working still must.

  # means patching nothing, because `$colorscheme` stays `default` and is only
  # ever special-cased for `dracula` (checked, in _colors-public.scss and the
  # two _common-*.scss).
  #

  # `MangoService.qml` drives mango through `mmsg -s -d <func>`, the dwl-era
  # flag form. mango 0.16 answers `{"error":"unknown command"}` and EXITS 0, so
  # every one of these did nothing and reported nothing — the failure this repo
  # is named for. The launcher was the visible half: picking an app ran
  # `CompositorService.spawn` → `MangoService.spawn` → nothing. docs/adr/0025.
  #
  # A patch, not a settings workaround: there are five call sites and only one
  # is the launcher, and `mmsg dispatch spawn_shell` makes the app a child of
  # MANGO in the session scope rather than of the shell inside
  # `noctalia.service`, where a mode switch would kill it with the bar.
  #
  # `--replace-fail`, so a version bump that renames any of these is a BUILD
  # error. The verbs are checked against mango's own function table by
  # checks/static.sh. `-g -A` and `-s -t` are left alone deliberately — they
  # need a different call shape, not a different spelling (docs/adr/0020).
